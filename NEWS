2.0.7
 * #1032: Fix a bug in which a Borg archive gets created even when a database hook fails.
 * #1043: Support Btrfs subvolume paths in "source_directories" even when the subvolume is mounted
   elsewhere.
 * #1048: Ignore Btrfs subvolumes whose read-only status can't be determined.
 * #1083: Add "debug_passphrase"/"display_passphrase" options and a "{unixtime}" placeholder in
   support of Borg 2 features.
 * #1099: Clarify documentation on command hooks order of execution.
 * #1100: Fix a bug in which "borg --version" failing isn't considered a "fail" state in a command
   hook.
 * #1108: Fix a bug in which quoted "extra_borg_options" values containing spaces are passed to Borg
   incorrectly.
 * #1108: Add a "--comment" flag to the "create" action for creating an archive with a comment.
 * Use the Bandit security analysis tool when running tests.
 * SECURITY: Add timeouts to all monitoring hooks to prevent hangs on network requests, e.g. due to
   a compromised monitoring server holding requests open.
 * SECURITY: For the "spot" check, use a more secure source of randomness when selecting paths to
   check.

2.0.6
 * #1068: Fix a warning from LVM about leaked file descriptors.
 * #1086: Fix for the "spot" check breaking when the "--progress" flag is used.
 * #1089: Fix for the "spot" check erroring when a checksum command errors.
 * #1091: Fix for the "config generate" action generating invalid configuration when upgrading
   deprecated command hooks.
 * #1093: Fix for the LVM hook erroring when the "--dry-run" flag is used.
 * #1094: Fix incorrect documentation about customizing Borg exit codes:
   https://torsion.org/borgmatic/docs/how-to/customize-warnings-and-errors/
 * #1095: Fix for the "spot" check's "xxh64sum_command" option erroring on commands containing
   spaces.
 * Add support for Borg 2's "s3:" and "b2:" repository URLs, so you can backup to S3 or B2 cloud
   storage services even without using Rclone.
 * During the "spot" check, truncate log messages containing many file paths.

2.0.5
 * #1033: Add a "password_transport" option to the MariaDB and MySQL database hooks for customizing
   how borgmatic transmits passwords to the database client.
 * #1078: Add "keep_3monthly" and "keep_13weekly" options for customizing "prune" action archive
   retention.
 * #1078: Add a "use_chunks_archive" option for controlling whether Borg uses its chunks cache
   directory.
 * #1078: For the "compact" action, pass "--dry-run" through to Borg.
 * #1085: Fix a regression in which the default monitoring verbosity is 0 (warnings only) instead of
   1 (info about steps borgmatic is taking). This prevented logs from showing up in monitoring
   services like Healthchecks unless you had an explicit monitoring verbosity set.
 * Move Mastodon social hosting from Fosstodon to FLOSS.social: https://floss.social/@borgmatic
 * The borgmatic project no longer accepts pull requests on GitHub. But see
   https://torsion.org/borgmatic/#contributing for how you can still submit pull requests. You can
   even use your GitHub account to login.

2.0.4
 * #1072: Fix path rewriting for non-root patterns in the ZFS, Btrfs, and LVM hooks.
 * #1073: Clarify the documentation about when an "after: error" command hook runs and how it

 * #1075: Fix an incorrect warning about Borg placeholders being unsupported in a command hook.
 * #1080: If the exact same "everything" command hook is present in multiple configuration files,
   only run it once.

2.0.3
 * #1065: Fix a regression in monitoring hooks in which an error pinged the finish state instead of
   the fail state.
 * #1066: Add a "states" option to command hooks, so you can optionally skip an "after" hook if
   borgmatic encounters an error.
 * #1071: Fix an error in the LVM hook when removing a snapshot directory.

2.0.2
 * #1035: Document potential performance issues and workarounds with the ZFS, Btrfs, and LVM hooks:
   https://torsion.org/borgmatic/docs/how-to/snapshot-your-filesystems/
 * #1053: Display a nicer error message when the "recreate" action encounters an archive that
   already exists.
 * #1059: Fix a regression in which soft failure exit codes in command hooks were not respected.
 * #1060: Fix action command hooks getting run too many times when multiple borgmatic actions are
   executed (implicitly or explicitly).
 * #1060: Don't run action command hooks for actions listed in the "skip_actions" option.
 * #1062: Fix a regression that broke environment variable interpolation.
 * #1063: List the configured "when" action names in the log entries for command hooks.

2.0.1
 * #1057: Fix argument parsing to avoid using Python 3.12+ string features. Now borgmatic will
   work with Python 3.9, 3.10, and 3.11 again.

2.0.0
 * TL;DR: More flexible, completely revamped command hooks. All configuration options settable on
   the command-line. New configuration options for many command-line flags (including verbosity!).
   New "key import" and "recreate" actions. Almost everything is backwards compatible—but mind those
   deprecation warnings!
 * #262: Add a "default_actions" option that supports disabling default actions when borgmatic is
   run without any command-line arguments.
 * #303: Deprecate the "--override" flag in favor of direct command-line flags for every borgmatic
   configuration option. See the documentation for more information:
   https://torsion.org/borgmatic/docs/how-to/make-per-application-backups/#configuration-overrides
 * #303: Add configuration options that serve as defaults for some (but not all) command-line
   action flags. For example, each entry in "repositories:" now has an "encryption" option that
   applies to the "repo-create" action, serving as a default for the "--encryption" flag. See the
   documentation for more information: https://torsion.org/borgmatic/docs/reference/configuration/
 * #345: Add a "key import" action to import a repository key from backup.
 * #422: Add home directory expansion to file-based and KeePassXC credential hooks.
 * #610: Add a "recreate" action for recreating archives, for instance for retroactively excluding
   particular files from existing archives.
 * #790, #821: Deprecate all "before_*", "after_*" and "on_error" command hooks in favor of more
   flexible "commands:". See the documentation for more information:
   https://torsion.org/borgmatic/docs/how-to/add-preparation-and-cleanup-steps-to-backups/
 * #790: BREAKING: For both new and deprecated command hooks, run a configured "after" hook even if
   an error occurs first. This allows you to perform cleanup steps that correspond to "before"
   preparation commands—even when something goes wrong.
 * #790: BREAKING: Run all command hooks (both new and deprecated) respecting the
   "working_directory" option if configured, meaning that hook commands are run in that directory.
 * #793: Add configuration options for all verbosity and logging flags, so you don't have to set
   them on the command-line.
 * #836: Add a custom command option for the SQLite hook.
 * #837: Add custom command options for the MongoDB hook.
 * #1010: When using Borg 2, don't pass the "--stats" flag to "borg prune".
 * #1020: Document a database use case involving a temporary database client container:
   https://torsion.org/borgmatic/docs/how-to/backup-your-databases/#database-containers
 * #1037: Fix an error with the "extract" action when both a remote repository and a
   "working_directory" are used.
 * #1044: Fix an error in the systemd credential hook when the credential name contains a "."
   character.
 * #1047: Add "key-file" and "yubikey" options to the KeePassXC credential hook.
 * #1048: Fix a "no such file or directory" error in ZFS, Btrfs, and LVM hooks with nested
   directories that reside on separate devices/filesystems.
 * #1050: Fix a failure in the "spot" check when the archive contains a symlink.
 * #1051: Add configuration filename to the "Successfully ran configuration file" log message.

1.9.14
 * #409: With the PagerDuty monitoring hook, send borgmatic logs to PagerDuty so they show up in the
   incident UI. See the documentation for more information:
   https://torsion.org/borgmatic/docs/how-to/monitor-your-backups/#pagerduty-hook
 * #936: Clarify Zabbix monitoring hook documentation about creating items:
   https://torsion.org/borgmatic/docs/how-to/monitor-your-backups/#zabbix-hook
 * #1017: Fix a regression in which some MariaDB/MySQL passwords were not escaped correctly.
 * #1021: Fix a regression in which the "exclude_patterns" option didn't expand "~" (the user's
   home directory). This fix means that all "patterns" and "patterns_from" also now expand "~".
 * #1023: Fix an error in the Btrfs hook when attempting to snapshot a read-only subvolume. Now,
   read-only subvolumes are ignored since Btrfs can't actually snapshot them.

1.9.13
 * #975: Add a "compression" option to the PostgreSQL database hook.
 * #1001: Fix a ZFS error during snapshot cleanup.
 * #1003: In the Zabbix monitoring hook, support Zabbix 7.2's authentication changes.
 * #1009: Send database passwords to MariaDB and MySQL via anonymous pipe, which is more secure than
   using an environment variable.
 * #1013: Send database passwords to MongoDB via anonymous pipe, which is more secure than using
   "--password" on the command-line!
 * #1015: When ctrl-C is pressed, more strongly encourage Borg to actually exit.
 * Add a "verify_tls" option to the Uptime Kuma monitoring hook for disabling TLS verification.
 * Add "tls" options to the MariaDB and MySQL database hooks to enable or disable TLS encryption
   between client and server.

1.9.12
 * #1005: Fix the credential hooks to avoid using Python 3.12+ string features. Now borgmatic will
   work with Python 3.9, 3.10, and 3.11 again.

1.9.11
 * #795: Add credential loading from file, KeePassXC, and Docker/Podman secrets. See the
   documentation for more information:
   https://torsion.org/borgmatic/docs/how-to/provide-your-passwords/
 * #996: Fix the "create" action to omit the repository label prefix from Borg's output when
   databases are enabled.
 * #998: Send the "encryption_passphrase" option to Borg via an anonymous pipe, which is more secure
   than using an environment variable.
 * #999: Fix a runtime directory error from a conflict between "extra_borg_options" and special file
   detection.
 * #1001: For the ZFS, Btrfs, and LVM hooks, only make snapshots for root patterns that come from
   a borgmatic configuration option (e.g. "source_directories")—not from other hooks within
   borgmatic.
 * #1001: Fix a ZFS/LVM error due to colliding snapshot mount points for nested datasets or logical
   volumes.
 * #1001: Don't try to snapshot ZFS datasets that have the "canmount=off" property.
 * Fix another error in the Btrfs hook when a subvolume mounted at "/" is configured in borgmatic's
   source directories.

1.9.10
 * #966: Add a "{credential ...}" syntax for loading systemd credentials into borgmatic
   configuration files. See the documentation for more information:
   https://torsion.org/borgmatic/docs/how-to/provide-your-passwords/
 * #987: Fix a "list" action error when the "encryption_passcommand" option is set.
 * #987: When both "encryption_passcommand" and "encryption_passphrase" are configured, prefer
   "encryption_passphrase" even if it's an empty value.
 * #988: With the "max_duration" option or the "--max-duration" flag, run the archives and
   repository checks separately so they don't interfere with one another. Previously, borgmatic
   refused to run checks in this situation.
 * #989: Fix the log message code to avoid using Python 3.10+ logging features. Now borgmatic will
   work with Python 3.9 again.
 * Capture and delay any log records produced before logging is fully configured, so early log
   records don't get lost.
 * Add support for Python 3.13.

1.9.9
 * #635: Log the repository path or label on every relevant log message, not just some logs.
 * #961: When the "encryption_passcommand" option is set, call the command once from borgmatic to
   collect the encryption passphrase and then pass it to Borg multiple times. See the documentation
   for more information: https://torsion.org/borgmatic/docs/how-to/provide-your-passwords/
 * #981: Fix a "spot" check file count delta error.
 * #982: Fix for borgmatic "exclude_patterns" and "exclude_from" recursing into excluded
   subdirectories.
 * #983: Fix the Btrfs hook to support subvolumes with names like "@home" different from their
   mount points.
 * #985: Change the default value for the "--original-hostname" flag from "localhost" to no host
   specified. This way, the "restore" action works without a hostname if there's a single matching
   database dump.

1.9.8
 * #979: Fix root patterns so they don't have an invalid "sh:" prefix before getting passed to Borg.
 * Expand the recent contributors documentation section to include ticket submitters—not just code
   contributors—because there are multiple ways to contribute to the project! See:
   https://torsion.org/borgmatic/#recent-contributors

1.9.7
 * #855: Add a Sentry monitoring hook. See the documentation for more information:
   https://torsion.org/borgmatic/docs/how-to/monitor-your-backups/#sentry-hook
 * #968: Fix for a "spot" check error when a filename in the most recent archive contains a newline.
 * #970: Fix for an error when there's a blank line in the configured patterns or excludes.
 * #971: Fix for "exclude_from" files being completely ignored.
 * #977: Fix for "exclude_patterns" and "exclude_from" not supporting explicit pattern styles (e.g.,
   "sh:" or "re:").

1.9.6
 * #959: Fix an error in the Btrfs hook when a subvolume mounted at "/" is configured in borgmatic's
   source directories.
 * #960: Fix for archives storing relative source directory paths such that they contain the working
   directory.
 * #960: Fix the "spot" check to support relative source directory paths.
 * #962: For the ZFS, Btrfs, and LVM hooks, perform path rewriting for excludes and patterns in
   addition to the existing source directories rewriting.
 * #962: Under the hood, merge all configured source directories, excludes, and patterns into a
   unified temporary patterns file for passing to Borg. The borgmatic configuration options remain
   unchanged.
 * #962: For the LVM hook, add support for nested logical volumes.
 * #965: Fix a borgmatic runtime directory error when running the "spot" check with a database hook
   enabled.
 * #969: Fix the "restore" action to work on database dumps without a port when a default port is
   present in configuration.
 * Fix the "spot" check to no longer consider pipe files within an archive for file comparisons.
 * Fix the "spot" check to have a nicer error when there are no source paths to compare.
 * Fix auto-excluding of special files (when databases are configured) to support relative source
   directory paths.
 * Drop support for Python 3.8, which has been end-of-lifed.

1.9.5
 * #418: Backup and restore databases that have the same name but with different ports, hostnames,
   or hooks.
 * #947: To avoid a hang in the database hooks, error and exit when the borgmatic runtime
   directory overlaps with the configured excludes.
 * #954: Fix a findmnt command error in the Btrfs hook by switching to parsing JSON output.
 * #956: Fix the printing of a color reset code even when color is disabled.
 * #958: Drop colorama as a library dependency.
 * When the ZFS, Btrfs, or LVM hooks aren't configured, don't try to cleanup snapshots for them.

1.9.4
 * #80 (beta): Add an LVM hook for snapshotting and backing up LVM logical volumes. See the
   documentation for more information:
   https://torsion.org/borgmatic/docs/how-to/snapshot-your-filesystems/
 * #251 (beta): Add a Btrfs hook for snapshotting and backing up Btrfs subvolumes. See the
   documentation for more information:
   https://torsion.org/borgmatic/docs/how-to/snapshot-your-filesystems/
 * #926: Fix a library error when running within a PyInstaller bundle.
 * #950: Fix a snapshot unmount error in the ZFS hook when using nested datasets.
 * Update the ZFS hook to discover and snapshot ZFS datasets even if they are parent/grandparent
   directories of your source directories.
 * Reorganize data source and monitoring hooks to make developing new hooks easier.

1.9.3
 * #261 (beta): Add a ZFS hook for snapshotting and backing up ZFS datasets. See the documentation
   for more information: https://torsion.org/borgmatic/docs/how-to/snapshot-your-filesystems/
 * Remove any temporary copies of the manifest file created in support of the "bootstrap" action.
 * Deprecate the "store_config_files" option at the global scope and move it under the "bootstrap"
   hook. See the documentation for more information:
   https://torsion.org/borgmatic/docs/how-to/extract-a-backup/#extract-the-configuration-files-used-to-create-an-archive
 * Require the runtime directory to be an absolute path.
 * Add a "--deleted" flag to the "repo-list" action for listing deleted archives that haven't
   yet been compacted (Borg 2 only).
 * Promote the "spot" check from a beta feature to stable.

1.9.2
 * #441: Apply the "umask" option to all relevant actions, not just some of them.
 * #722: Remove the restriction that the "extract" and "mount" actions must match a single
   repository. Now they work more like other actions, where each repository is applied in turn.
 * #932: Fix the missing build backend setting in pyproject.toml to allow Fedora builds.
 * #934: Update the logic that probes for the borgmatic streaming database dump, bootstrap
   metadata, and check state directories to support more platforms and use cases. See the
   documentation for more information:
   https://torsion.org/borgmatic/docs/how-to/backup-your-databases/#runtime-directory
 * #934: Add the "RuntimeDirectory" and "StateDirectory" options to the sample systemd service
   file to support the new runtime and state directory logic.
 * #939: Fix borgmatic ignoring the "BORG_RELOCATED_REPO_ACCESS_IS_OK" and
   "BORG_UNKNOWN_UNENCRYPTED_REPO_ACCESS_IS_OK" environment variables.
 * Add a Pushover monitoring hook. See the documentation for more information:
   https://torsion.org/borgmatic/docs/how-to/monitor-your-backups/#pushover-hook

1.9.1
 * #928: Fix the user runtime directory location on macOS (and possibly Cygwin).
 * #930: Fix an error with the sample systemd service when no credentials are configured.
 * #931: Fix an error when implicitly upgrading the check state directory from ~/.borgmatic to
   ~/.local/state/borgmatic across filesystems.

1.9.0
 * #609: Fix the glob expansion of "source_directories" values to respect the "working_directory"
   option.
 * #609: BREAKING: Apply the "working_directory" option to all actions, not just "create". This
   includes repository paths, destination paths, mount points, etc.
 * #562: Deprecate the "borgmatic_source_directory" option in favor of "user_runtime_directory"
   and "user_state_directory".
 * #562: BREAKING: Move the default borgmatic streaming database dump and bootstrap metadata
   directory from ~/.borgmatic to /run/user/$UID/borgmatic, which is more XDG-compliant. You can
   override this location with the new "user_runtime_directory" option. Existing archives with
   database dumps at the old location are still restorable. 
 * #562, #638: Move the default check state directory from ~/.borgmatic to 
   ~/.local/state/borgmatic. This is more XDG-compliant and also prevents these state files from
   getting backed up (unless you explicitly include them). You can override this location with the
   new "user_state_directory" option. After the first time you run the "check" action with borgmatic
   1.9.0, you can safely delete the ~/.borgmatic directory.
 * #838: BREAKING: With Borg 1.4+, store database dumps and bootstrap metadata in a "/borgmatic"
   directory within a backup archive, so the path doesn't depend on the current user. This means
   that you can now backup as one user and restore or bootstrap as another user, among other use
   cases.
 * #902: Add loading of encrypted systemd credentials. See the documentation for more information:
   https://torsion.org/borgmatic/docs/how-to/provide-your-passwords/#using-systemd-service-credentials
 * #911: Add a "key change-passphrase" action to change the passphrase protecting a repository key.
 * #914: Fix a confusing apparent hang when when the repository location changes, and instead
   show a helpful error message.
 * #915: BREAKING: Rename repository actions like "rcreate" to more explicit names like
   "repo-create" for compatibility with recent changes in Borg 2.0.0b10.
 * #918: BREAKING: When databases are configured, don't auto-enable the "one_file_system" option,
   as existing auto-excludes of special files should be sufficient to prevent Borg from hanging on
   them. But if this change causes problems for you, you can always enable "one_file_system"
   explicitly.
 * #919: Clarify the command-line help for the "--config" flag.
 * #919: Document a policy for versioning and breaking changes:
   https://torsion.org/borgmatic/docs/how-to/upgrade/#versioning-and-breaking-changes
 * #921: BREAKING: Change soft failure command hooks to skip only the current repository rather than
   all repositories in the configuration file.
 * #922: Replace setup.py (Python packaging metadata) with the more modern pyproject.toml.
 * When using Borg 2, default the "archive_name_format" option to just "{hostname}", as Borg 2 does
   not require unique archive names; identical archive names form a common "series" that can be
   targeted together. See the Borg 2 documentation for more information:
   https://borgbackup.readthedocs.io/en/2.0.0b13/changes.html#borg-1-2-x-1-4-x-to-borg-2-0
 * Add support for Borg 2's "rclone:" repository URLs, so you can backup to 70+ cloud storage
   services whether or not they support Borg explicitly.
 * Add support for Borg 2's "sftp://" repository URLs.
 * Update the "--match-archives" and "--archive" flags to support Borg 2 series names or archive
   hashes.
 * Add a "--match-archives" flag to the "prune" action.
 * Add "--local-path" and "--remote-path" flags to the "config bootstrap" action for setting the
   Borg executable paths used for bootstrapping.
 * Add a "--user-runtime-directory" flag to the "config bootstrap" action for helping borgmatic
   locate the bootstrap metadata stored in an archive.
 * Add a Zabbix monitoring hook. See the documentation for more information:
   https://torsion.org/borgmatic/docs/how-to/monitor-your-backups/#zabbix-hook
 * Add a tarball of borgmatic's HTML documentation to the packages on the project page.

1.8.14
 * #896: Fix an error in borgmatic rcreate/init on an empty repository directory with Borg 1.4.
 * #898: Add glob ("*") support to the "--repository" flag. Just quote any values containing
   globs so your shell doesn't interpret them.
 * #899: Fix for a "bad character" Borg error in which the "spot" check fed Borg an invalid pattern.
 * #900: Fix for a potential traceback (TypeError) during the handling of another error.
 * #904: Clarify the configuration reference about the "spot" check options:
   https://torsion.org/borgmatic/docs/reference/configuration/
 * #905: Fix the "source_directories_must_exist" option to work with relative "source_directories"
   paths when a "working_directory" is set.

1.8.13
 * #298: Add "delete" and "rdelete" actions to delete archives or entire repositories.
 * #785: Add an "only_run_on" option to consistency checks so you can limit a check to running on
   particular days of the week. See the documentation for more information:
   https://torsion.org/borgmatic/docs/how-to/deal-with-very-large-backups/#check-days
 * #885: Add an Uptime Kuma monitoring hook. See the documentation for more information:
   https://torsion.org/borgmatic/docs/how-to/monitor-your-backups/#uptime-kuma-hook
 * #886: Fix a PagerDuty hook traceback with Python < 3.10.
 * #889: Fix the Healthchecks ping body size limit, restoring it to the documented 100,000 bytes.

1.8.12
 * #817: Add a "--max-duration" flag to the "check" action and a "max_duration" option to the
   repository check configuration. This tells Borg to interrupt a repository check after a certain
   duration.
 * #860: Fix interaction between environment variable interpolation in constants and shell escaping.
 * #863: When color output is disabled (explicitly or implicitly), don't prefix each log line with
   the log level.
 * #865: Add an "upload_buffer_size" option to set the size of the upload buffer used in "create"
   action.
 * #866: Fix "Argument list too long" error in the "spot" check when checking hundreds of thousands
   of files at once.

 * #851: Fix lack of file extraction when using "extract --strip-components all" on a path with a
   leading slash.
 * #854: Fix a traceback when the "data" consistency check is used.
 * #857: Fix a traceback with "check --only spot" when the "spot" check is unconfigured.

1.8.10
 * #656 (beta): Add a "spot" consistency check that compares file counts and contents between your
   source files and the latest archive, ensuring they fall within configured tolerances. This can
   catch problems like incorrect excludes, inadvertent deletes, files changed by malware, etc. See
   the documentation for more information:
   https://torsion.org/borgmatic/docs/how-to/deal-with-very-large-backups/#spot-check
 * #779: When "--match-archives *" is used with "check" action, don't skip Borg's orphaned objects
   check.
 * #842: When a command hook exits with a soft failure, ping the log and finish states for any
   configured monitoring hooks.
 * #843: Add documentation link to Loki dashboard for borgmatic:
   https://torsion.org/borgmatic/docs/how-to/monitor-your-backups/#loki-hook

 * #848: SECURITY: Mask the password when logging a MongoDB dump or restore command.
 * Fix handling of the NO_COLOR environment variable to ignore an empty value.
 * Add documentation about backing up containerized databases by configuring borgmatic to exec into
   a container to run a dump command:
   https://torsion.org/borgmatic/docs/how-to/backup-your-databases/#database-containers

1.8.9
 * #311: Add custom dump/restore command options for MySQL and MariaDB.
 * #811: Add an "access_token" option to the ntfy monitoring hook for authenticating
   without username/password.
 * #827: When the "--json" flag is given, suppress console escape codes so as not to
   interfere with JSON output.
 * #829: Fix "--override" values containing deprecated section headers not actually overriding
   configuration options under deprecated section headers.
 * #835: Add support for the NO_COLOR environment variable. See the documentation for more
   information:
   https://torsion.org/borgmatic/docs/how-to/set-up-backups/#colored-output
 * #839: Add log sending for the Apprise logging hook, enabled by default. See the documentation for
   more information:
   https://torsion.org/borgmatic/docs/how-to/monitor-your-backups/#apprise-hook
 * #839: Document a potentially breaking shell quoting edge case within error hooks:
   https://torsion.org/borgmatic/docs/how-to/monitor-your-backups/#error-hooks
 * #840: When running the "rcreate" action and the repository already exists but with a different
   encryption mode than requested, error.
 * Switch from Drone to Gitea Actions for continuous integration.
 * Rename scripts/run-end-to-end-dev-tests to scripts/run-end-to-end-tests and use it in both dev
   and CI for better dev-CI parity.
 * Clarify documentation about restoring a database: borgmatic does not create the database upon
   restore.

1.8.8
 * #370: For the PostgreSQL hook, pass the "PGSSLMODE" environment variable through to Borg when the
   database's configuration omits the "ssl_mode" option.
 * #818: Allow the "--repository" flag to match across multiple configuration files.
 * #820: Fix broken repository detection in the "rcreate" action with Borg 1.4. The issue did not
   occur with other versions of Borg.
 * #822: Fix broken escaping logic in the PostgreSQL hook's "pg_dump_command" option.
 * SECURITY: Prevent additional shell injection attacks within the PostgreSQL hook.

1.8.7
 * #736: Store included configuration files within each backup archive in support of the "config
   bootstrap" action. Previously, only top-level configuration files were stored.
 * #798: Elevate specific Borg warnings to errors or squash errors to
 * warnings. See the documentation for more information:
   https://torsion.org/borgmatic/docs/how-to/customize-warnings-and-errors/
 * #810: SECURITY: Prevent shell injection attacks within the PostgreSQL hook, the MongoDB hook, the
   SQLite hook, the "borgmatic borg" action, and command hook variable/constant interpolation.
 * #814: Fix a traceback when providing an invalid "--override" value for a list option.

1.8.6
 * #767: Add an "--ssh-command" flag to the "config bootstrap" action for setting a custom SSH
   command, as no configuration is available (including the "ssh_command" option) until
   bootstrapping completes.
 * #794: Fix a traceback when the "repositories" option contains both strings and key/value pairs.
 * #800: Add configured repository labels to the JSON output for all actions.
 * #802: The "check --force" flag now runs checks even if "check" is in "skip_actions".
 * #804: Validate the configured action names in the "skip_actions" option.
 * #807: Stream SQLite databases directly to Borg instead of dumping to an intermediate file.
 * When logging commands that borgmatic executes, log the environment variables that
   borgmatic sets for those commands. (But don't log their values, since they often contain
   passwords.)

1.8.5
 * #701: Add a "skip_actions" option to skip running particular actions, handy for append-only or
   checkless configurations. See the documentation for more information:
   https://torsion.org/borgmatic/docs/how-to/set-up-backups/#skipping-actions
 * #701: Deprecate the "disabled" value for the "checks" option in favor of the new "skip_actions"
   option.
 * #745: Constants now apply to included configuration, not just the file doing the includes. As a
   side effect of this change, constants no longer apply to option names and only substitute into
   configuration values.
 * #779: Add a "--match-archives" flag to the "check" action for selecting the archives to check,
   overriding the existing "archive_name_format" and "match_archives" options in configuration.
 * #779: Only parse "--override" values as complex data types when they're for options of those
   types.
 * #782: Fix environment variable interpolation within configured repository paths.
 * #782: Add configuration constant overriding via the existing "--override" flag.
 * #783: Upgrade ruamel.yaml dependency to support version 0.18.x.
 * #784: Drop support for Python 3.7, which has been end-of-lifed.

1.8.4
 * #715: Add a monitoring hook for sending backup status to a variety of monitoring services via the
   Apprise library. See the documentation for more information:
   https://torsion.org/borgmatic/docs/how-to/monitor-your-backups/#apprise-hook
 * #748: When an archive filter causes no matching archives for the "rlist" or "info"
   actions, warn the user and suggest how to remove the filter.
 * #768: Fix a traceback when an invalid command-line flag or action is used.
 * #771: Fix normalization of deprecated sections ("location:", "storage:", "hooks:", etc.) to
   support empty sections without erroring.
 * #774: Disallow the "--dry-run" flag with the "borg" action, as borgmatic can't guarantee the Borg
   command won't have side effects.

1.8.3
 * #665: BREAKING: Simplify logging logic as follows: Syslog verbosity is now disabled by
   default, but setting the "--syslog-verbosity" flag enables it regardless of whether you're at an
   interactive console. Additionally, "--log-file-verbosity" and "--monitoring-verbosity" now
   default to 1 (info about steps borgmatic is taking) instead of 0. And both syslog logging and
   file logging can be enabled simultaneously.
 * #743: Add a monitoring hook for sending backup status and logs to Grafana Loki. See the
   documentation for more information:
   https://torsion.org/borgmatic/docs/how-to/monitor-your-backups/#loki-hook
 * #753: When "archive_name_format" is not set, filter archives using the default archive name
   format.
 * #754: Fix error handling to log command output as one record per line instead of truncating
   too-long output and swallowing the end of some Borg error messages.
 * #757: Update documentation so "sudo borgmatic" works for pipx borgmatic installations.
 * #761: Fix for borgmatic not stopping Borg immediately when the user presses ctrl-C.
 * Update documentation to recommend installing/upgrading borgmatic with pipx instead of pip. See the
   documentation for more information:
   https://torsion.org/borgmatic/docs/how-to/set-up-backups/#installation
   https://torsion.org/borgmatic/docs/how-to/upgrade/#upgrading-borgmatic

1.8.2
 * #345: Add "key export" action to export a copy of the repository key for safekeeping in case
   the original goes missing or gets damaged.
 * #727: Add a MariaDB database hook that uses native MariaDB commands instead of the deprecated
   MySQL ones. Be aware though that any existing backups made with the "mysql_databases:" hook are
   only restorable with a "mysql_databases:" configuration.
 * #738: Fix for potential data loss (data not getting restored) in which the database "restore"
   action didn't actually restore anything and indicated success anyway.
 * Remove the deprecated use of the MongoDB hook's "--db" flag for database restoration.
 * Add source code reference documentation for getting oriented with the borgmatic code as a
   developer: https://torsion.org/borgmatic/docs/reference/source-code/

1.8.1
 * #326: Add documentation for restoring a database to an alternate host:
   https://torsion.org/borgmatic/docs/how-to/backup-your-databases/#restore-to-an-alternate-host
 * #697: Add documentation for "bootstrap" action:
   https://torsion.org/borgmatic/docs/how-to/extract-a-backup/#extract-the-configuration-files-used-to-create-an-archive
 * #725: Add "store_config_files" option for disabling the automatic backup of configuration files
   used by the "config bootstrap" action.
 * #728: Fix for "prune" action error when using the "keep_exclude_tags" option.
 * #730: Fix for Borg's interactive prompt on the "check --repair" action automatically getting
   answered "NO" even when the "check_i_know_what_i_am_doing" option isn't set.
 * #732: Include multiple configuration files with a single "!include". See the documentation for
   more information:
   https://torsion.org/borgmatic/docs/how-to/make-per-application-backups/#multiple-merge-includes
 * #734: Omit "--glob-archives" or "--match-archives" Borg flag when its value would be "*" (meaning
   all archives).

1.8.0
 * #575: BREAKING: For the "borgmatic borg" action, instead of implicitly injecting
   repository/archive into the resulting Borg command-line, pass repository to Borg via an
   environment variable and make archive available for explicit use in your commands. See the
   documentation for more information:
   https://torsion.org/borgmatic/docs/how-to/run-arbitrary-borg-commands/
 * #719: Fix an error when running "borg key export" through borgmatic.
 * #720: Fix an error when dumping a database and the "exclude_nodump" option is set.
 * #724: Add "check_i_know_what_i_am_doing" option to bypass Borg confirmation prompt when running
   "check --repair".
 * When merging two configuration files, error gracefully if the two files do not adhere to the same
   format.
 * #721: Remove configuration sections ("location:", "storage:", "hooks:", etc.), while still
   keeping deprecated support for them. Now, all options are at the same level, and you don't need
   to worry about commenting/uncommenting section headers when you change an option (if you remove
   your sections first).
 * #721: BREAKING: The retention prefix and the consistency prefix can no longer have different
   values (unless one is not set).
 * #721: BREAKING: The storage umask and the hooks umask can no longer have different values (unless
   one is not set).
 * BREAKING: Flags like "--config" that previously took multiple values now need to be given once
   per value, e.g. "--config first.yaml --config second.yaml" instead of "--config first.yaml
   second.yaml". This prevents argument parsing errors on ambiguous commands.
 * BREAKING: Remove the deprecated (and silently ignored) "--successful" flag on the "list" action,
   as newer versions of Borg list successful (non-checkpoint) archives by default.
 * All deprecated configuration option values now generate warning logs.
 * Remove the deprecated (and non-functional) "--excludes" flag in favor of excludes within
   configuration.
 * Fix an error when logging too-long command output during error handling. Now, long command output
   is truncated before logging.

1.7.15
 * #326: Add configuration options and command-line flags for backing up a database from one
   location while restoring it somewhere else.
 * #399: Add a documentation troubleshooting note for MySQL/MariaDB authentication errors.
 * #529: Remove upgrade-borgmatic-config command for upgrading borgmatic 1.1.0 INI-style
   configuration.
 * #529: Deprecate generate-borgmatic-config in favor of new "config generate" action.
 * #529: Deprecate validate-borgmatic-config in favor of new "config validate" action.
 * #697, #712, #716: Extract borgmatic configuration from backup via new "config bootstrap"
   action—even when borgmatic has no configuration yet!
 * #669: Add sample systemd user service for running borgmatic as a non-root user.
 * #711, #713: Fix an error when "data" check time files are accessed without getting upgraded
   first.

1.7.14
 * #484: Add a new verbosity level (-2) to disable output entirely (for console, syslog, log file,
   or monitoring), so not even errors are shown.
 * #688: Tweak archive check probing logic to use the newest timestamp found when multiple exist.
 * #659: Add Borg 2 date-based matching flags to various actions for archive selection.
 * #703: Fix an error when loading the configuration schema on Fedora Linux.
 * #704: Fix "check" action error when repository and archive checks are configured but the archive
   check gets skipped due to the configured frequency.
 * #706: Fix "--archive latest" on "list" and "info" actions that only worked on the first of
   multiple configured repositories.

1.7.13
 * #375: Restore particular PostgreSQL schemas from a database dump via "borgmatic restore --schema"
   flag. See the documentation for more information:
   https://torsion.org/borgmatic/docs/how-to/backup-your-databases/#restore-particular-schemas
 * #678: Fix error from PostgreSQL when dumping a database with a "format" of "plain".
 * #678: Fix PostgreSQL hook to support "psql_command" and "pg_restore_command" options containing
   commands with arguments.
 * #678: Fix calls to psql in PostgreSQL hook to ignore "~/.psqlrc", whose settings can break
   database dumping.
 * #680: Add support for logging each log line as a JSON object via global "--log-json" flag.
 * #682: Fix "source_directories_must_exist" option to expand globs and tildes in source directories.
 * #684: Rename "master" development branch to "main" to use more inclusive language. You'll need to
   update your development checkouts accordingly.
 * #686: Add fish shell completion script so you can tab-complete on the borgmatic command-line. See
   the documentation for more information:
   https://torsion.org/borgmatic/docs/how-to/set-up-backups/#shell-completion
 * #687: Fix borgmatic error when not finding the configuration schema for certain "pip install
   --editable" development installs.
 * #688: Fix archive checks being skipped even when particular archives haven't been checked
   recently. This occurred when using multiple borgmatic configuration files with different
   "archive_name_format"s, for instance.
 * #691: Fix error in "borgmatic restore" action when the configured repository path is relative
   instead of absolute.
 * #694: Run "borgmatic borg" action without capturing output so interactive prompts and flags like
   "--progress" still work.

1.7.12
 * #413: Add "log_file" context to command hooks so your scripts can consume the borgmatic log file.
   See the documentation for more information:
   https://torsion.org/borgmatic/docs/how-to/add-preparation-and-cleanup-steps-to-backups/
 * #666, #670: Fix error when running the "info" action with the "--match-archives" or "--archive"
   flags. Also fix the "--match-archives"/"--archive" flags to correctly override the
   "match_archives" configuration option for the "transfer", "list", "rlist", and "info" actions.
 * #668: Fix error when running the "prune" action with both "archive_name_format" and "prefix"
   options set.
 * #672: Selectively shallow merge certain mappings or sequences when including configuration files.
   See the documentation for more information:
   https://torsion.org/borgmatic/docs/how-to/make-per-application-backups/#shallow-merge
 * #672: Selectively omit list values when including configuration files. See the documentation for
   more information:
   https://torsion.org/borgmatic/docs/how-to/make-per-application-backups/#list-merge
 * #673: View the results of configuration file merging via "validate-borgmatic-config --show" flag.
   See the documentation for more information:
   https://torsion.org/borgmatic/docs/how-to/make-per-application-backups/#debugging-includes
 * Add optional support for running end-to-end tests and building documentation with rootless Podman
   instead of Docker.

1.7.11
 * #479, #588: BREAKING: Automatically use the "archive_name_format" option to filter which archives
   get used for borgmatic actions that operate on multiple archives. Override this behavior with the
   new "match_archives" option in the storage section. This change is "breaking" in that it silently
   changes which archives get considered for "rlist", "prune", "check", etc. See the documentation
   for more information:
   https://torsion.org/borgmatic/docs/how-to/make-per-application-backups/#archive-naming
 * #479, #588: The "prefix" options have been deprecated in favor of the new "archive_name_format"
   auto-matching behavior and the "match_archives" option.
 * #658: Add "--log-file-format" flag for customizing the log message format. See the documentation
   for more information:
   https://torsion.org/borgmatic/docs/how-to/inspect-your-backups/#logging-to-file
 * #662: Fix regression in which the "check_repositories" option failed to match repositories.
 * #663: Fix regression in which the "transfer" action produced a traceback.
 * Add spellchecking of source code during test runs.

1.7.10
 * #396: When a database command errors, display and log the error message instead of swallowing it.
 * #501: Optionally error if a source directory does not exist via "source_directories_must_exist"
   option in borgmatic's location configuration.
 * #576: Add support for "file://" paths within "repositories" option.
 * #612: Define and use custom constants in borgmatic configuration files. See the documentation for
   more information:
   https://torsion.org/borgmatic/docs/how-to/make-per-application-backups/#constant-interpolation
 * #618: Add support for BORG_FILES_CACHE_TTL environment variable via "borg_files_cache_ttl" option
   in borgmatic's storage configuration.
 * #623: Fix confusing message when an error occurs running actions for a configuration file.
 * #635: Add optional repository labels so you can select a repository via "--repository yourlabel"
   at the command-line. See the configuration reference for more information:
   https://torsion.org/borgmatic/docs/reference/configuration/
 * #649: Add documentation on backing up a database running in a container:
   https://torsion.org/borgmatic/docs/how-to/backup-your-databases/#database-containers
 * #655: Fix error when databases are configured and a source directory doesn't exist.
 * Add code style plugins to enforce use of Python f-strings and prevent single-letter variables.
   To join in the pedantry, refresh your test environment with "tox --recreate".
 * Rename scripts/run-full-dev-tests to scripts/run-end-to-end-dev-tests and make it run end-to-end
   tests only. Continue using tox to run unit and integration tests.

1.7.9
 * #295: Add a SQLite database dump/restore hook.
 * #304: Change the default action order when no actions are specified on the command-line to:
   "create", "prune", "compact", "check". If you'd like to retain the old ordering ("prune" and
   "compact" first), then specify actions explicitly on the command-line.
 * #304: Run any command-line actions in the order specified instead of using a fixed ordering.
 * #564: Add "--repository" flag to all actions where it makes sense, so you can run borgmatic on
   a single configured repository instead of all of them.
 * #628: Add a Healthchecks "log" state to send borgmatic logs to Healthchecks without signalling
   success or failure.
 * #647: Add "--strip-components all" feature on the "extract" action to remove leading path
   components of files you extract. Must be used with the "--path" flag.
 * Add support for Python 3.11.

1.7.8
 * #620: With the "create" action and the "--list" ("--files") flag, only show excluded files at
   verbosity 2.
 * #621: Add optional authentication to the ntfy monitoring hook.
 * With the "create" action, only one of "--list" ("--files") and "--progress" flags can be used.
   This lines up with the new behavior in Borg 2.0.0b5.
 * Internally support new Borg 2.0.0b5 "--filter" status characters / item flags for the "create"
   action.
 * Fix the "create" action with the "--dry-run" flag querying for databases when a PostgreSQL/MySQL
   "all" database is configured. Now, these queries are skipped due to the dry run.
 * Add "--repository" flag to the "rcreate" action to optionally select one configured repository to
   create.
 * Add "--progress" flag to the "transfer" action, new in Borg 2.0.0b5.
 * Add "checkpoint_volume" configuration option to creates checkpoints every specified number of
   bytes during a long-running backup, new in Borg 2.0.0b5.

1.7.7
 * #642: Add MySQL database hook "add_drop_database" configuration option to control whether dumped
   MySQL databases get dropped right before restore.
 * #643: Fix for potential data loss (data not getting backed up) when dumping large "directory"
   format PostgreSQL/MongoDB databases. Prior to the fix, these dumps would not finish writing to
   disk before Borg consumed them. Now, the dumping process completes before Borg starts. This only
   applies to "directory" format databases; other formats still stream to Borg without using
   temporary disk space.
 * Fix MongoDB "directory" format to work with mongodump/mongorestore without error. Prior to this
   fix, only the "archive" format worked.

1.7.6
 * #393, #438, #560: Optionally dump "all" PostgreSQL/MySQL databases to separate files instead of
   one combined dump file, allowing more convenient restores of individual databases. You can enable
   this by specifying the database dump "format" option when the database is named "all".
 * #602: Fix logs that interfere with JSON output by making warnings go to stderr instead of stdout.
 * #622: Fix traceback when include merging configuration files on ARM64.
 * #629: Skip warning about excluded special files when no special files have been excluded.
 * #630: Add configuration options for database command customization: "list_options",
   "restore_options", and "analyze_options" for PostgreSQL, "restore_options" for MySQL, and
   "restore_options" for MongoDB.

1.7.5
 * #311: Override PostgreSQL dump/restore commands via configuration options.
 * #604: Fix traceback when a configuration section is present but lacking any options.
 * #607: Clarify documentation examples for include merging and deep merging.
 * #611: Fix "data" consistency check to support "check_last" and consistency "prefix" options.
 * #613: Clarify documentation about multiple repositories and separate configuration files.

1.7.4
 * #596: Fix special file detection erroring when broken symlinks are encountered.
 * #597, #598: Fix regression in which "check" action errored on certain systems ("Cannot determine
   Borg repository ID").

1.7.3
 * #357: Add "break-lock" action for removing any repository and cache locks leftover from Borg
   aborting.
 * #360: To prevent Borg hangs, unconditionally delete stale named pipes before dumping databases.
 * #587: When database hooks are enabled, auto-exclude special files from a "create" action to
   prevent Borg from hanging. You can override/prevent this behavior by explicitly setting the
   "read_special" option to true.
 * #587: Warn when ignoring a configured "read_special" value of false, as true is needed when
   database hooks are enabled.
 * #589: Update sample systemd service file to allow system "idle" (e.g. a video monitor turning
   off) while borgmatic is running.
 * #590: Fix for potential data loss (data not getting backed up) when the "patterns_from" option
   was used with "source_directories" (or the "~/.borgmatic" path existed, which got injected into
   "source_directories" implicitly). The fix is for borgmatic to convert "source_directories" into
   patterns whenever "patterns_from" is used, working around a Borg bug:
   https://github.com/borgbackup/borg/issues/6994
 * #590: In "borgmatic create --list" output, display which files get excluded from the backup due
   to patterns or excludes.
 * #591: Add support for Borg 2's "--match-archives" flag. This replaces "--glob-archives", which
   borgmatic now treats as an alias for "--match-archives". But note that the two flags have
   slightly different syntax. See the Borg 2 changelog for more information:
   https://borgbackup.readthedocs.io/en/2.0.0b3/changes.html#version-2-0-0b3-2022-10-02
 * Fix for "borgmatic --archive latest" not finding the latest archive when a verbosity is set.

1.7.2
 * #577: Fix regression in which "borgmatic info --archive ..." showed repository info instead of
   archive info with Borg 1.
 * #582: Fix hang when database hooks are enabled and "patterns" contains a parent directory of
   "~/.borgmatic".

1.7.1
 * #542: Make the "source_directories" option optional. This is useful for "check"-only setups or
   using "patterns" exclusively.
 * #574: Fix for potential data loss (data not getting backed up) when the "patterns" option was
   used with "source_directories" (or the "~/.borgmatic" path existed, which got injected into
   "source_directories" implicitly). The fix is for borgmatic to convert "source_directories" into
   patterns whenever "patterns" is used, working around a Borg bug:
   https://github.com/borgbackup/borg/issues/6994

1.7.0
 * #463: Add "before_actions" and "after_actions" command hooks that run before/after all the
   actions for each repository. These new hooks are a good place to run per-repository steps like
   mounting/unmounting a remote filesystem.
 * #463: Update documentation to cover per-repository configurations:
   https://torsion.org/borgmatic/docs/how-to/make-per-application-backups/
 * #557: Support for Borg 2 while still working with Borg 1. This includes new borgmatic actions
   like "rcreate" (replaces "init"), "rlist" (list archives in repository), "rinfo" (show repository
   info), and "transfer" (for upgrading Borg repositories). For the most part, borgmatic tries to
   smooth over differences between Borg 1 and 2 to make your upgrade process easier. However, there
   are still a few cases where Borg made breaking changes. See the Borg 2.0 changelog for more
   information: https://www.borgbackup.org/releases/borg-2.0.html
 * #557: If you install Borg 2, you'll need to manually upgrade your existing Borg 1 repositories
   before use. Note that Borg 2 stable is not yet released as of this borgmatic release, so don't
   use Borg 2 for production until it is! See the documentation for more information:
   https://torsion.org/borgmatic/docs/how-to/upgrade/#upgrading-borg
 * #557: Rename several configuration options to match Borg 2: "remote_rate_limit" is now
   "upload_rate_limit", "numeric_owner" is "numeric_ids", and "bsd_flags" is "flags". borgmatic
   still works with the old options.
 * #557: Remote repository paths without the "ssh://" syntax are deprecated but still supported for
   now. Remote repository paths containing "~" are deprecated in borgmatic and no longer work in
   Borg 2.
 * #557: Omitting the "--archive" flag on the "list" action is deprecated when using Borg 2. Use
   the new "rlist" action instead.
 * #557: The "--dry-run" flag can now be used with the "rcreate"/"init" action.
 * #565: Fix handling of "repository" and "data" consistency checks to prevent invalid Borg flags.
 * #566: Modify "mount" and "extract" actions to require the "--repository" flag when multiple
   repositories are configured.
 * #571: BREAKING: Remove old-style command-line action flags like "--create, "--list", etc. If
   you're already using actions like "create" and "list" instead, this change should not affect you.
 * #571: BREAKING: Rename "--files" flag on "prune" action to "--list", as it lists archives, not
   files.
 * #571: Add "--list" as alias for "--files" flag on "create" and "export-tar" actions.
 * Add support for disabling TLS verification in Healthchecks monitoring hook with "verify_tls"
   option.

1.6.6
 * #559: Update documentation about configuring multiple consistency checks or multiple databases.
 * #560: Fix all database hooks to error when the requested database to restore isn't present in the
   Borg archive.
 * #561: Fix command-line "--override" flag to continue supporting old configuration file formats.
 * #563: Fix traceback with "create" action and "--json" flag when a database hook is configured.

1.6.5
 * #553: Fix logging to include the full traceback when Borg experiences an internal error, not just
   the first few lines.
 * #554: Fix all monitoring hooks to warn if the server returns an HTTP 4xx error. This can happen
   with Healthchecks, for instance, when using an invalid ping URL.
 * #555: Fix environment variable plumbing so options like "encryption_passphrase" and
   "encryption_passcommand" in one configuration file aren't used for other configuration files.

1.6.4
 * #546, #382: Keep your repository passphrases and database passwords outside of borgmatic's
   configuration file with environment variable interpolation. See the documentation for more
   information: https://torsion.org/borgmatic/docs/how-to/provide-your-passwords/

1.6.3
 * #541: Add "borgmatic list --find" flag for searching for files across multiple archives, useful
   for hunting down that file you accidentally deleted so you can extract it. See the documentation

   https://torsion.org/borgmatic/docs/how-to/inspect-your-backups/#searching-for-a-file
 * #543: Add a monitoring hook for sending push notifications via ntfy. See the documentation for
   more information: https://torsion.org/borgmatic/docs/how-to/monitor-your-backups/#ntfy-hook
 * Fix Bash completion script to no longer alter your shell's settings (complain about unset
   variables or error on pipe failures).
 * Deprecate "borgmatic list --successful" flag, as listing only non-checkpoint (successful)
   archives is now the default in newer versions of Borg.

1.6.2
 * #523: Reduce the default consistency check frequency and support configuring the frequency
   independently for each check. Also add "borgmatic check --force" flag to ignore configured
   frequencies. See the documentation for more information:
   https://torsion.org/borgmatic/docs/how-to/deal-with-very-large-backups/#check-frequency
 * #536: Fix generate-borgmatic-config to support more complex schema changes like the new
   Healthchecks configuration options when the "--source" flag is used.
 * #538: Add support for "borgmatic borg debug" command.
 * #539: Add "generate-borgmatic-config --overwrite" flag to replace an existing destination file.
 * Add Bash completion script so you can tab-complete the borgmatic command-line. See the
   documentation for more information:
   https://torsion.org/borgmatic/docs/how-to/set-up-backups/#shell-completion

1.6.1
 * #294: Add Healthchecks monitoring hook "ping_body_limit" option to configure how many bytes of
   logs to send to the Healthchecks server.
 * #402: Remove the error when "archive_name_format" is specified but a retention prefix isn't. 
 * #420: Warn when an unsupported variable is used in a hook command.
 * #439: Change connection failures for monitoring hooks (Healthchecks, Cronitor, PagerDuty, and
   Cronhub) to be warnings instead of errors. This way, the monitoring system failing does not block
   backups.
 * #460: Add Healthchecks monitoring hook "send_logs" option to enable/disable sending borgmatic
   logs to the Healthchecks server.
 * #525: Add Healthchecks monitoring hook "states" option to only enable pinging for particular
   monitoring states (start, finish, fail).
 * #528: Improve the error message when a configuration override contains an invalid value.
 * #531: BREAKING: When deep merging common configuration, merge colliding list values by appending
   them. Previously, one list replaced the other.
 * #532: When a configuration include is a relative path, load it from either the current working
   directory or from the directory containing the file doing the including. Previously, only the
   working directory was used.
 * Add a randomized delay to the sample systemd timer to spread out the load on a server.
 * Change the configuration format for borgmatic monitoring hooks (Healthchecks, Cronitor,
   PagerDuty, and Cronhub) to specify the ping URL / integration key as a named option. The intent
   is to support additional options (some in this release). This change is backwards-compatible.
 * Add emojis to documentation table of contents to make it easier to find particular how-to and
   reference guides at a glance.

1.6.0
 * #381: BREAKING: Greatly simplify configuration file reuse by deep merging when including common
   configuration. See the documentation for more information:
   https://torsion.org/borgmatic/docs/how-to/make-per-application-backups/#include-merging
 * #473: BREAKING: Instead of executing "before" command hooks before all borgmatic actions run (and
   "after" hooks after), execute these hooks right before/after the corresponding action. E.g.,
   "before_check" now runs immediately before the "check" action. This better supports running
   timing-sensitive tasks like pausing containers. Side effect: before/after command hooks now run
   once for each configured repository instead of once per configuration file. Additionally, the
   "repositories" interpolated variable has been changed to "repository", containing the path to the
   current repository for the hook. See the documentation for more information:
   https://torsion.org/borgmatic/docs/how-to/add-preparation-and-cleanup-steps-to-backups/
 * #513: Add mention of sudo's "secure_path" option to borgmatic installation documentation.
 * #515: Fix "borgmatic borg key ..." to pass parameters to Borg in the correct order.
 * #516: Fix handling of TERM signal to exit borgmatic, not just forward the signal to Borg.
 * #517: Fix borgmatic exit code (so it's zero) when initial Borg calls fail but later retries
   succeed.
 * Change Healthchecks logs truncation size from 10k bytes to 100k bytes, corresponding to that
   same change on Healthchecks.io.

1.5.24
 * #431: Add "working_directory" option to support source directories with relative paths.
 * #444: When loading a configuration file that is unreadable due to file permissions, warn instead
   of erroring. This supports running borgmatic as a non-root user with configuration in ~/.config
   even if there is an unreadable global configuration file in /etc.
 * #469: Add "repositories" context to "before_*" and "after_*" command action hooks. See the
   documentation for more information:
   https://torsion.org/borgmatic/docs/how-to/add-preparation-and-cleanup-steps-to-backups/
 * #486: Fix handling of "patterns_from" and "exclude_from" options to error instead of warning when
   referencing unreadable files and "create" action is run.
 * #507: Fix Borg usage error in the "compact" action when running "borgmatic --dry-run". Now, skip
   "compact" entirely during a dry run.

1.5.23
 * #394: Compact repository segments and free space with new "borgmatic compact" action. Borg 1.2+
   only. Also run "compact" by default when no actions are specified, as "prune" in Borg 1.2 no
   longer frees up space unless "compact" is run.
 * #394: When using the "atime", "bsd_flags", "numeric_owner", or "remote_rate_limit" options,
   tailor the flags passed to Borg depending on the Borg version.
 * #480, #482: Fix traceback when a YAML validation error occurs.

1.5.22
 * #288: Add database dump hook for MongoDB.
 * #470: Move mysqldump options to the beginning of the command due to MySQL bug 30994.
 * #471: When command-line configuration override produces a parse error, error cleanly instead of
   tracebacking.
 * #476: Fix unicode error when restoring particular MySQL databases.
 * Drop support for Python 3.6, which has been end-of-lifed.
 * Add support for Python 3.10.

1.5.21
 * #28: Optionally retry failing backups via "retries" and "retry_wait" configuration options.
 * #306: Add "list_options" MySQL configuration option for passing additional arguments to MySQL
   list command.
 * #459: Add support for old version (2.x) of jsonschema library.

1.5.20
 * Re-release with correct version without dev0 tag.

1.5.19
 * #387: Fix error when configured source directories are not present on the filesystem at the time
   of backup. Now, Borg will complain, but the backup will still continue.
 * #455: Mention changing borgmatic path in cron documentation.
 * Update sample systemd service file with more granular read-only filesystem settings.
 * Move Gitea and GitHub hosting from a personal namespace to an organization for better
   collaboration with related projects.

   https://torsion.org/borgmatic/docs/how-to/set-up-backups/#other-ways-to-install

1.5.15
 * #419: Document use case of running backups conditionally based on laptop power level:
   https://torsion.org/borgmatic/docs/how-to/backup-to-a-removable-drive-or-an-intermittent-server/
 * #425: Run arbitrary Borg commands with new "borgmatic borg" action. See the documentation for

   IRC connection info: https://torsion.org/borgmatic/#issues

1.5.13
 * #373: Document that passphrase is used for Borg keyfile encryption, not just repokey encryption.
 * #404: Add support for ruamel.yaml 0.17.x YAML parsing library.
 * Update systemd service example to return a permission error when a system call isn't permitted
   (instead of terminating borgmatic outright).
 * Drop support for Python 3.5, which has been end-of-lifed.
 * Add support for Python 3.9.
 * Update versions of test dependencies (test_requirements.txt and test containers).
 * Only support black code formatter on Python 3.8+. New black dependencies make installation
   difficult on older versions of Python.
 * Replace "improve this documentation" form with link to support and ticket tracker.

1.5.12
 * Fix for previous release with incorrect version suffix in setup.py. No other changes.

1.5.11

 * #352: Lock down systemd security settings in sample systemd service file.
 * #355: Fix traceback when a database hook value is null in a configuration file.
 * #361: Merge override values when specifying the "--override" flag multiple times. The previous
   behavior was to take the value of the last "--override" flag only.
 * #367: Fix traceback when upgrading old INI-style configuration with upgrade-borgmatic-config.
 * #368: Fix signal forwarding from borgmatic to Borg resulting in recursion traceback.
 * #369: Document support for Borg placeholders in repository names.

 * #350: Fix traceback when a configuration directory is non-readable due to directory permissions.
 * Add documentation navigation links on left side of all documentation pages.
 * Clarify documentation on configuration overrides, specifically the portion about list syntax:
   http://torsion.org/borgmatic/docs/how-to/make-per-application-backups/#configuration-overrides

1.5.7
 * #327: Fix broken pass-through of BORG_* environment variables to Borg.
 * #328: Fix duplicate logging to Healthchecks and send "after_*" hooks output to Healthchecks.
 * #331: Add SSL support to PostgreSQL database configuration.
 * #333: Fix for potential data loss (data not getting backed up) when borgmatic omitted configured
   source directories in certain situations. Specifically, this occurred when two source directories
   on different filesystems were related by parentage (e.g. "/foo" and "/foo/bar/baz") and the
   one_file_system option was enabled.
 * Update documentation code fragments theme to better match the rest of the page.
 * Improve configuration reference documentation readability via more aggressive word-wrapping in
   configuration schema descriptions.

1.5.6
 * #292: Allow before_backup and similar hooks to exit with a soft failure without altering the
   monitoring status on Healthchecks or other providers. Support this by waiting to ping monitoring
   services with a "start" status until after before_* hooks finish. Failures in before_* hooks
   still trigger a monitoring "fail" status.
 * #316: Fix hang when a stale database dump named pipe from an aborted borgmatic run remains on
   disk.
 * #323: Fix for certain configuration options like ssh_command impacting Borg invocations for
   separate configuration files.
 * #324: Add "borgmatic extract --strip-components" flag to remove leading path components when
   extracting an archive.
 * Tweak comment indentation in generated configuration file for clarity.
 * Link to Borgmacator GNOME AppIndicator from monitoring documentation.

1.5.5
 * #314: Fix regression in support for PostgreSQL's "directory" dump format. Unlike other dump
   formats, the "directory" dump format does not stream directly to/from Borg.
 * #315: Fix enabled database hooks to implicitly set one_file_system configuration option to true.
   This prevents Borg from reading devices like /dev/zero and hanging.
 * #316: Fix hang when streaming a database dump to Borg with implicit duplicate source directories
   by deduplicating them first.
 * #319: Fix error message when there are no MySQL databases to dump for "all" databases.
 * Improve documentation around the installation process. Specifically, making borgmatic commands
   runnable via the system PATH and offering a global install option.

1.5.4
 * #310: Fix legitimate database dump command errors (exit code 1) not being treated as errors by
   borgmatic.
 * For database dumps, replace the named pipe on every borgmatic run. This prevent hangs on stale
   pipes left over from previous runs.
 * Fix error handling to handle more edge cases when executing commands.

1.5.3
 * #258: Stream database dumps and restores directly to/from Borg without using any additional
   filesystem space. This feature is automatic, and works even on restores from archives made with
   previous versions of borgmatic.
 * #293: Documentation on macOS launchd permissions issues with work-around for Full Disk Access.
 * Remove "borgmatic restore --progress" flag, as it now conflicts with streaming database restores.

1.5.2
 * #301: Fix MySQL restore error on "all" database dump by excluding system tables.
 * Fix PostgreSQL restore error on "all" database dump by using "psql" for the restore instead of
   "pg_restore".

1.5.1
 * #289: Tired of looking up the latest successful archive name in order to pass it to borgmatic
   actions? Me too. Now you can specify "--archive latest" to all actions that accept an archive
   flag.
 * #290: Fix the "--stats" and "--files" flags so that they yield output at verbosity 0.
 * Reduce the default verbosity of borgmatic logs sent to Healthchecks monitoring hook. Now, it's
   warnings and errors only. You can increase the verbosity via the "--monitoring-verbosity" flag.
 * Add security policy documentation in SECURITY.md.

1.5.0
 * #245: Monitor backups with PagerDuty hook integration. See the documentation for more
   information: https://torsion.org/borgmatic/docs/how-to/monitor-your-backups/#pagerduty-hook
 * #255: Add per-action hooks: "before_prune", "after_prune", "before_check", and "after_check".
 * #274: Add ~/.config/borgmatic.d as another configuration directory default.
 * #277: Customize Healthchecks log level via borgmatic "--monitoring-verbosity" flag.
 * #280: Change "exclude_if_present" option to support multiple filenames that indicate a directory
   should be excluded from backups, rather than just a single filename.
 * #284: Backup to a removable drive or intermittent server via "soft failure" feature. See the
   documentation for more information:
   https://torsion.org/borgmatic/docs/how-to/backup-to-a-removable-drive-or-an-intermittent-server/
 * #287: View consistency check progress via "--progress" flag for "check" action.
 * For "create" and "prune" actions, no longer list files or show detailed stats at any verbosities
   by default. You can opt back in with "--files" or "--stats" flags.
 * For "list" and "info" actions, show repository names even at verbosity 0.

1.4.22
 * #276, #285: Disable colored output when "--json" flag is used, so as to produce valid JSON output.
 * After a backup of a database dump in directory format, properly remove the dump directory.
 * In "borgmatic --help", don't expand $HOME in listing of default "--config" paths.

1.4.21
 * #268: Override particular configuration options from the command-line via "--override" flag. See
   the documentation for more information:
   https://torsion.org/borgmatic/docs/how-to/make-per-application-backups/#configuration-overrides
 * #270: Only trigger "on_error" hooks and monitoring failures for "prune", "create", and "check"
   actions, and not for other actions.
 * When pruning with verbosity level 1, list pruned and kept archives. Previously, this information
   was only shown at verbosity level 2.

1.4.20
 * Fix repository probing during "borgmatic init" to respect verbosity flag and remote_path option.
 * #249: Update Healthchecks/Cronitor/Cronhub monitoring integrations to fire for "check" and
   "prune" actions, not just "create".

1.4.19
 * #259: Optionally change the internal database dump path via "borgmatic_source_directory" option
   in location configuration section.
 * #271: Support piping "borgmatic list" output to grep by logging certain log levels to console
   stdout and others to stderr.
 * Retain colored output when piping or redirecting in an interactive terminal.
 * Add end-to-end tests for database dump and restore. These are run on developer machines with
   Docker Compose for approximate parity with continuous integration tests.

1.4.18
 * Fix "--repository" flag to accept relative paths.
 * Fix "borgmatic umount" so it only runs Borg once instead of once per repository / configuration
   file.
 * #253: Mount whole repositories via "borgmatic mount" without any "--archive" flag.
 * #269: Filter listed paths via "borgmatic list --path" flag.

1.4.17
 * #235: Pass extra options directly to particular Borg commands, handy for Borg options that
   borgmatic does not yet support natively. Use "extra_borg_options" in the storage configuration
   section.
 * #266: Attempt to repair any inconsistencies found during a consistency check via
   "borgmatic check --repair" flag.

1.4.16
 * #256: Fix for "before_backup" hook not triggering an error when the command contains "borg" and
   has an exit code of 1.
 * #257: Fix for garbled Borg file listing when using "borgmatic create --progress" with
   verbosity level 1 or 2.
 * #260: Fix for missing Healthchecks monitoring payload or HTTP 500 due to incorrect unicode
   encoding.

1.4.15
 * Fix for database dump removal incorrectly skipping some database dumps.
 * #123: Support for mounting an archive as a FUSE filesystem via "borgmatic mount" action, and
   unmounting via "borgmatic umount". See the documentation for more information:
   https://torsion.org/borgmatic/docs/how-to/extract-a-backup/#mount-a-filesystem

1.4.14
 * Show summary log errors regardless of verbosity level, and log the "summary:" header with a log
   level based on the contained summary logs.

1.4.13
 * Show full error logs at "--verbosity 0" so you can see command output without upping the
   verbosity level.

1.4.12
 * #247: With "borgmatic check", consider Borg warnings as errors.
 * Dial back the display of inline error logs a bit, so failed command output doesn't appear
   multiple times in the logs (well, except for the summary).

1.4.11
 * #241: When using the Healthchecks monitoring hook, include borgmatic logs in the payloads for
   completion and failure pings.
 * With --verbosity level 1 or 2, show error logs both inline when they occur and in the summary
   logs at the bottom. With lower verbosity levels, suppress the summary and show error logs when
   they occur.

1.4.10
 * #246: Fix for "borgmatic restore" showing success and incorrectly extracting archive files, even
   when no databases are configured to restore. As this can overwrite files from the archive and
   lead to data loss, please upgrade to get the fix before using "borgmatic restore".
 * Reopen the file given by "--log-file" flag if an external program rotates the log file while
   borgmatic is running.

1.4.9
 * #228: Database dump hooks for MySQL/MariaDB, so you can easily dump your databases before backups
   run.
 * #243: Fix repository does not exist error with "borgmatic extract" when repository is remote.

1.4.8
 * Monitor backups with Cronhub hook integration. See the documentation for more information:
   https://torsion.org/borgmatic/docs/how-to/monitor-your-backups/#cronhub-hook
 * Fix Healthchecks/Cronitor hooks to skip actions when the borgmatic "--dry-run" flag is used.

1.4.7
 * #238: In documentation, clarify when Healthchecks/Cronitor hooks fire in relation to other hooks.
 * #239: Upgrade your borgmatic configuration to get new options and comments via
   "generate-borgmatic-config --source". See the documentation for more information:
   https://torsion.org/borgmatic/docs/how-to/upgrade/#upgrading-your-configuration

1.4.6
 * Verbosity level "-1" for even quieter output: Errors only (#236).

1.4.5
 * Log to file instead of syslog via command-line "--log-file" flag (#233).

1.4.4
 * #234: Support for Borg --keep-exclude-tags and --exclude-nodump options.

1.4.3
 * Monitor backups with Cronitor hook integration. See the documentation for more information:
   https://torsion.org/borgmatic/docs/how-to/monitor-your-backups/#cronitor-hook

1.4.2
 * Extract files to a particular directory via "borgmatic extract --destination" flag.
 * Rename "borgmatic extract --restore-path" flag to "--path" to reduce confusion with the separate
   "borgmatic restore" action. Any uses of "--restore-path" will continue working.

1.4.1
 * #229: Restore backed up PostgreSQL databases via "borgmatic restore" action. See the
   documentation for more information:
   https://torsion.org/borgmatic/docs/how-to/backup-your-databases/
 * Documentation on how to develop borgmatic's documentation:
   https://torsion.org/borgmatic/docs/how-to/develop-on-borgmatic/#documentation-development

1.4.0
 * #225: Database dump hooks for PostgreSQL, so you can easily dump your databases before backups
   run.
 * #230: Rename "borgmatic list --pattern-from" flag to "--patterns-from" to match Borg.

1.3.26
 * #224: Fix "borgmatic list --successful" with a slightly better heuristic for listing successful
   (non-checkpoint) archives.

1.3.25
 * #223: Dead man's switch to detect when backups start failing silently, implemented via
   healthchecks.io hook integration. See the documentation for more information:
   https://torsion.org/borgmatic/docs/how-to/monitor-your-backups/#healthchecks-hook
 * Documentation on monitoring and alerting options for borgmatic backups:
   https://torsion.org/borgmatic/docs/how-to/monitor-your-backups/
