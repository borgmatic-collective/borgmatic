1.6.1
 * #294: Add Healthchecks monitoring hook "ping_body_limit" option to configure how many bytes of
   logs to send to the Healthchecks server.
 * #402: Remove the error when "archive_name_format" is specified but a retention prefix isn't. 
 * #420: Warn when an unsupported variable is used in a hook command.
 * #439: Change connection failures for monitoring hooks (Healthchecks, Cronitor, PagerDuty, and
   Cronhub) to be warnings instead of errors. This way, the monitoring system failing does not block
   backups.
 * #460: Add Healthchecks monitoring hook "send_logs" option to enable/disable sending borgmatic
   logs to the Healthchecks server.
 * #525: Add Healthchecks monitoring hook "states" option to only enable pinging for particular
   monitoring states (start, finish, fail).
 * #528: Improve the error message when a configuration override contains an invalid value.
 * #531: BREAKING: When deep merging common configuration, merge colliding list values by appending
   them. Previously, one list replaced the other.
 * #532: When a configuration include is a relative path, load it from either the current working
   directory or from the directory containing the file doing the including. Previously, only the
   working directory was used.
 * Add a randomized delay to the sample systemd timer to spread out the load on a server.
 * Change the configuration format for borgmatic monitoring hooks (Healthchecks, Cronitor,
   PagerDuty, and Cronhub) to specify the ping URL / integration key as a named option. The intent
   is to support additional options (some in this release). This change is backwards-compatible.
 * Add emojis to documentation table of contents to make it easier to find particular how-to and
   reference guides at a glance.

1.6.0
 * #381: BREAKING: Greatly simplify configuration file reuse by deep merging when including common
   configuration. See the documentation for more information:
   https://torsion.org/borgmatic/docs/how-to/make-per-application-backups/#include-merging
 * #473: BREAKING: Instead of executing "before" command hooks before all borgmatic actions run (and
   "after" hooks after), execute these hooks right before/after the corresponding action. E.g.,
   "before_check" now runs immediately before the "check" action. This better supports running
   timing-sensitive tasks like pausing containers. Side effect: before/after command hooks now run
   once for each configured repository instead of once per configuration file. Additionally, the
   "repositories" interpolated variable has been changed to "repository", containing the path to the
   current repository for the hook. See the documentation for more information:
   https://torsion.org/borgmatic/docs/how-to/add-preparation-and-cleanup-steps-to-backups/
 * #513: Add mention of sudo's "secure_path" option to borgmatic installation documentation.
 * #515: Fix "borgmatic borg key ..." to pass parameters to Borg in the correct order.
 * #516: Fix handling of TERM signal to exit borgmatic, not just forward the signal to Borg.
 * #517: Fix borgmatic exit code (so it's zero) when initial Borg calls fail but later retries
   succeed.
 * Change Healthchecks logs truncation size from 10k bytes to 100k bytes, corresponding to that
   same change on Healthchecks.io.

1.5.24
 * #431: Add "working_directory" option to support source directories with relative paths.
 * #444: When loading a configuration file that is unreadable due to file permissions, warn instead
   of erroring. This supports running borgmatic as a non-root user with configuration in ~/.config
   even if there is an unreadable global configuration file in /etc.
 * #469: Add "repositories" context to "before_*" and "after_*" command action hooks. See the
   documentation for more information:
   https://torsion.org/borgmatic/docs/how-to/add-preparation-and-cleanup-steps-to-backups/
 * #486: Fix handling of "patterns_from" and "exclude_from" options to error instead of warning when
   referencing unreadable files and "create" action is run.
 * #507: Fix Borg usage error in the "compact" action when running "borgmatic --dry-run". Now, skip
   "compact" entirely during a dry run.

1.5.23
 * #394: Compact repository segments and free space with new "borgmatic compact" action. Borg 1.2+
   only. Also run "compact" by default when no actions are specified, as "prune" in Borg 1.2 no
   longer frees up space unless "compact" is run.
 * #394: When using the "atime", "bsd_flags", "numeric_owner", or "remote_rate_limit" options,
   tailor the flags passed to Borg depending on the Borg version.
 * #480, #482: Fix traceback when a YAML validation error occurs.

1.5.22
 * #288: Add database dump hook for MongoDB.
 * #470: Move mysqldump options to the beginning of the command due to MySQL bug 30994.
 * #471: When command-line configuration override produces a parse error, error cleanly instead of
   tracebacking.
 * #476: Fix unicode error when restoring particular MySQL databases.
 * Drop support for Python 3.6, which has been end-of-lifed.
 * Add support for Python 3.10.

1.5.21
 * #28: Optionally retry failing backups via "retries" and "retry_wait" configuration options.
 * #306: Add "list_options" MySQL configuration option for passing additional arguments to MySQL
   list command.
 * #459: Add support for old version (2.x) of jsonschema library.

1.5.20
 * Re-release with correct version without dev0 tag.

1.5.19
 * #387: Fix error when configured source directories are not present on the filesystem at the time
   of backup. Now, Borg will complain, but the backup will still continue.
 * #455: Mention changing borgmatic path in cron documentation.
 * Update sample systemd service file with more granular read-only filesystem settings.
 * Move Gitea and GitHub hosting from a personal namespace to an organization for better
   collaboration with related projects.
 * 1k ★s on GitHub!

1.5.18
 * #389: Fix "message too long" error when logging to rsyslog.
 * #440: Fix traceback that can occur when dumping a database.

1.5.17

 * #407: Fix syslog logging on FreeBSD.
 * #430: Fix hang when restoring a PostgreSQL "tar" format database dump.
 * Better error messages! Switch the library used for validating configuration files (from pykwalify
   to jsonschema).
 * Link borgmatic Ansible role from installation documentation:
   https://torsion.org/borgmatic/docs/how-to/set-up-backups/#other-ways-to-install

1.5.15
 * #419: Document use case of running backups conditionally based on laptop power level:
   https://torsion.org/borgmatic/docs/how-to/backup-to-a-removable-drive-or-an-intermittent-server/
 * #425: Run arbitrary Borg commands with new "borgmatic borg" action. See the documentation for
   more information: https://torsion.org/borgmatic/docs/how-to/run-arbitrary-borg-commands/

1.5.14
 * #390: Add link to Hetzner storage offering from the documentation.
 * #398: Clarify canonical home of borgmatic in documentation.
 * #406: Clarify that spaces in path names should not be backslashed in path names.

   IRC connection info: https://torsion.org/borgmatic/#issues

1.5.13
 * #373: Document that passphrase is used for Borg keyfile encryption, not just repokey encryption.
 * #404: Add support for ruamel.yaml 0.17.x YAML parsing library.
 * Update systemd service example to return a permission error when a system call isn't permitted
   (instead of terminating borgmatic outright).
 * Drop support for Python 3.5, which has been end-of-lifed.
 * Add support for Python 3.9.
 * Update versions of test dependencies (test_requirements.txt and test containers).
 * Only support black code formatter on Python 3.8+. New black dependencies make installation
   difficult on older versions of Python.
 * Replace "improve this documentation" form with link to support and ticket tracker.

1.5.12
 * Fix for previous release with incorrect version suffix in setup.py. No other changes.

1.5.11

 * #352: Lock down systemd security settings in sample systemd service file.
 * #355: Fix traceback when a database hook value is null in a configuration file.
 * #361: Merge override values when specifying the "--override" flag multiple times. The previous
   behavior was to take the value of the last "--override" flag only.
 * #367: Fix traceback when upgrading old INI-style configuration with upgrade-borgmatic-config.
 * #368: Fix signal forwarding from borgmatic to Borg resulting in recursion traceback.
 * #369: Document support for Borg placeholders in repository names.

 * #350: Fix traceback when a configuration directory is non-readable due to directory permissions.
 * Add documentation navigation links on left side of all documentation pages.
 * Clarify documentation on configuration overrides, specifically the portion about list syntax:
   http://torsion.org/borgmatic/docs/how-to/make-per-application-backups/#configuration-overrides
 * Clarify documentation overview of monitoring options:
   http://torsion.org/borgmatic/docs/how-to/monitor-your-backups/

 * #339: Fix for intermittent timing-related test failure of logging function.
 * Clarify database documentation about excluding named pipes and character/block devices to prevent
   hangs.
 * Add documentation on how to make backups redundant with multiple repositories:
   https://torsion.org/borgmatic/docs/how-to/make-backups-redundant/

 * #336: Fix for traceback when running Cronitor, Cronhub, and PagerDuty monitor hooks.

1.5.7
 * #327: Fix broken pass-through of BORG_* environment variables to Borg.
 * #328: Fix duplicate logging to Healthchecks and send "after_*" hooks output to Healthchecks.
 * #331: Add SSL support to PostgreSQL database configuration.
 * #333: Fix for potential data loss (data not getting backed up) when borgmatic omitted configured
   source directories in certain situations. Specifically, this occurred when two source directories
   on different filesystems were related by parentage (e.g. "/foo" and "/foo/bar/baz") and the
   one_file_system option was enabled.
 * Update documentation code fragments theme to better match the rest of the page.
 * Improve configuration reference documentation readability via more aggressive word-wrapping in
   configuration schema descriptions.

1.5.6
 * #292: Allow before_backup and similiar hooks to exit with a soft failure without altering the
   monitoring status on Healthchecks or other providers. Support this by waiting to ping monitoring
   services with a "start" status until after before_* hooks finish. Failures in before_* hooks
   still trigger a monitoring "fail" status.
 * #316: Fix hang when a stale database dump named pipe from an aborted borgmatic run remains on
   disk.
 * #323: Fix for certain configuration options like ssh_command impacting Borg invocations for
   separate configuration files.
 * #324: Add "borgmatic extract --strip-components" flag to remove leading path components when
   extracting an archive.
 * Tweak comment indentation in generated configuration file for clarity.
 * Link to Borgmacator GNOME AppIndicator from monitoring documentation.

1.5.5
 * #314: Fix regression in support for PostgreSQL's "directory" dump format. Unlike other dump
   formats, the "directory" dump format does not stream directly to/from Borg.
 * #315: Fix enabled database hooks to implicitly set one_file_system configuration option to true.
   This prevents Borg from reading devices like /dev/zero and hanging.
 * #316: Fix hang when streaming a database dump to Borg with implicit duplicate source directories
   by deduplicating them first.
 * #319: Fix error message when there are no MySQL databases to dump for "all" databases.
 * Improve documentation around the installation process. Specifically, making borgmatic commands
   runnable via the system PATH and offering a global install option.

1.5.4
 * #310: Fix legitimate database dump command errors (exit code 1) not being treated as errors by
   borgmatic.
 * For database dumps, replace the named pipe on every borgmatic run. This prevent hangs on stale
   pipes left over from previous runs.
 * Fix error handling to handle more edge cases when executing commands.

1.5.3
 * #258: Stream database dumps and restores directly to/from Borg without using any additional
   filesystem space. This feature is automatic, and works even on restores from archives made with
   previous versions of borgmatic.
 * #293: Documentation on macOS launchd permissions issues with work-around for Full Disk Access.
 * Remove "borgmatic restore --progress" flag, as it now conflicts with streaming database restores.

1.5.2
 * #301: Fix MySQL restore error on "all" database dump by excluding system tables.
 * Fix PostgreSQL restore error on "all" database dump by using "psql" for the restore instead of
   "pg_restore".

1.5.1
 * #289: Tired of looking up the latest successful archive name in order to pass it to borgmatic
   actions? Me too. Now you can specify "--archive latest" to all actions that accept an archive
   flag.
 * #290: Fix the "--stats" and "--files" flags so that they yield output at verbosity 0.
 * Reduce the default verbosity of borgmatic logs sent to Healthchecks monitoring hook. Now, it's
   warnings and errors only. You can increase the verbosity via the "--monitoring-verbosity" flag.
 * Add security policy documentation in SECURITY.md.

1.5.0
 * #245: Monitor backups with PagerDuty hook integration. See the documentation for more
   information: https://torsion.org/borgmatic/docs/how-to/monitor-your-backups/#pagerduty-hook
 * #255: Add per-action hooks: "before_prune", "after_prune", "before_check", and "after_check".
 * #274: Add ~/.config/borgmatic.d as another configuration directory default.
 * #277: Customize Healthchecks log level via borgmatic "--monitoring-verbosity" flag.
 * #280: Change "exclude_if_present" option to support multiple filenames that indicate a directory
   should be excluded from backups, rather than just a single filename.
 * #284: Backup to a removable drive or intermittent server via "soft failure" feature. See the
   documentation for more information:
   https://torsion.org/borgmatic/docs/how-to/backup-to-a-removable-drive-or-an-intermittent-server/
 * #287: View consistency check progress via "--progress" flag for "check" action.
 * For "create" and "prune" actions, no longer list files or show detailed stats at any verbosities
   by default. You can opt back in with "--files" or "--stats" flags.
 * For "list" and "info" actions, show repository names even at verbosity 0.

1.4.22
 * #276, #285: Disable colored output when "--json" flag is used, so as to produce valid JSON ouput.
 * After a backup of a database dump in directory format, properly remove the dump directory.
 * In "borgmatic --help", don't expand $HOME in listing of default "--config" paths.

1.4.21
 * #268: Override particular configuration options from the command-line via "--override" flag. See
   the documentation for more information:
   https://torsion.org/borgmatic/docs/how-to/make-per-application-backups/#configuration-overrides
 * #270: Only trigger "on_error" hooks and monitoring failures for "prune", "create", and "check"
   actions, and not for other actions.
 * When pruning with verbosity level 1, list pruned and kept archives. Previously, this information
   was only shown at verbosity level 2.

1.4.20
 * Fix repository probing during "borgmatic init" to respect verbosity flag and remote_path option.
 * #249: Update Healthchecks/Cronitor/Cronhub monitoring integrations to fire for "check" and
   "prune" actions, not just "create".

1.4.19
 * #259: Optionally change the internal database dump path via "borgmatic_source_directory" option
   in location configuration section.
 * #271: Support piping "borgmatic list" output to grep by logging certain log levels to console
   stdout and others to stderr.
 * Retain colored output when piping or redirecting in an interactive terminal.
 * Add end-to-end tests for database dump and restore. These are run on developer machines with
   Docker Compose for approximate parity with continuous integration tests.

1.4.18
 * Fix "--repository" flag to accept relative paths.
 * Fix "borgmatic umount" so it only runs Borg once instead of once per repository / configuration
   file.
 * #253: Mount whole repositories via "borgmatic mount" without any "--archive" flag.
 * #269: Filter listed paths via "borgmatic list --path" flag.

1.4.17
 * #235: Pass extra options directly to particular Borg commands, handy for Borg options that
   borgmatic does not yet support natively. Use "extra_borg_options" in the storage configuration
   section.
 * #266: Attempt to repair any inconsistencies found during a consistency check via
   "borgmatic check --repair" flag.

1.4.16
 * #256: Fix for "before_backup" hook not triggering an error when the command contains "borg" and
   has an exit code of 1.
 * #257: Fix for garbled Borg file listing when using "borgmatic create --progress" with
   verbosity level 1 or 2.
 * #260: Fix for missing Healthchecks monitoring payload or HTTP 500 due to incorrect unicode
   encoding.

1.4.15
 * Fix for database dump removal incorrectly skipping some database dumps.
 * #123: Support for mounting an archive as a FUSE filesystem via "borgmatic mount" action, and
   unmounting via "borgmatic umount". See the documentation for more information:
   https://torsion.org/borgmatic/docs/how-to/extract-a-backup/#mount-a-filesystem

1.4.14
 * Show summary log errors regardless of verbosity level, and log the "summary:" header with a log
   level based on the contained summary logs.

1.4.13
 * Show full error logs at "--verbosity 0" so you can see command output without upping the
   verbosity level.

1.4.12
 * #247: With "borgmatic check", consider Borg warnings as errors.
 * Dial back the display of inline error logs a bit, so failed command output doesn't appear
   multiple times in the logs (well, except for the summary).

1.4.11
 * #241: When using the Healthchecks monitoring hook, include borgmatic logs in the payloads for
   completion and failure pings.
 * With --verbosity level 1 or 2, show error logs both inline when they occur and in the summary
   logs at the bottom. With lower verbosity levels, suppress the summary and show error logs when
   they occur.

1.4.10
 * #246: Fix for "borgmatic restore" showing success and incorrectly extracting archive files, even
   when no databases are configured to restore. As this can overwrite files from the archive and
   lead to data loss, please upgrade to get the fix before using "borgmatic restore".
 * Reopen the file given by "--log-file" flag if an external program rotates the log file while
   borgmatic is running.

1.4.9
 * #228: Database dump hooks for MySQL/MariaDB, so you can easily dump your databases before backups
   run.
 * #243: Fix repository does not exist error with "borgmatic extract" when repository is remote.

1.4.8
 * Monitor backups with Cronhub hook integration. See the documentation for more information:
   https://torsion.org/borgmatic/docs/how-to/monitor-your-backups/#cronhub-hook
 * Fix Healthchecks/Cronitor hooks to skip actions when the borgmatic "--dry-run" flag is used.

1.4.7
 * #238: In documentation, clarify when Healthchecks/Cronitor hooks fire in relation to other hooks.
 * #239: Upgrade your borgmatic configuration to get new options and comments via
   "generate-borgmatic-config --source". See the documentation for more information:
   https://torsion.org/borgmatic/docs/how-to/upgrade/#upgrading-your-configuration

1.4.6
 * Verbosity level "-1" for even quieter output: Errors only (#236).

1.4.5
 * Log to file instead of syslog via command-line "--log-file" flag (#233).

1.4.4
 * #234: Support for Borg --keep-exclude-tags and --exclude-nodump options.

1.4.3
 * Monitor backups with Cronitor hook integration. See the documentation for more information:
   https://torsion.org/borgmatic/docs/how-to/monitor-your-backups/#cronitor-hook

1.4.2
 * Extract files to a particular directory via "borgmatic extract --destination" flag.
 * Rename "borgmatic extract --restore-path" flag to "--path" to reduce confusion with the separate
   "borgmatic restore" action. Any uses of "--restore-path" will continue working.

1.4.1
 * #229: Restore backed up PostgreSQL databases via "borgmatic restore" action. See the
   documentation for more information:
   https://torsion.org/borgmatic/docs/how-to/backup-your-databases/
 * Documentation on how to develop borgmatic's documentation:
   https://torsion.org/borgmatic/docs/how-to/develop-on-borgmatic/#documentation-development

1.4.0
 * #225: Database dump hooks for PostgreSQL, so you can easily dump your databases before backups
   run.
 * #230: Rename "borgmatic list --pattern-from" flag to "--patterns-from" to match Borg.

1.3.26
 * #224: Fix "borgmatic list --successful" with a slightly better heuristic for listing successful
   (non-checkpoint) archives.

1.3.25
 * #223: Dead man's switch to detect when backups start failing silently, implemented via
   healthchecks.io hook integration. See the documentation for more information:
   https://torsion.org/borgmatic/docs/how-to/monitor-your-backups/#healthchecks-hook
 * Documentation on monitoring and alerting options for borgmatic backups:
   https://torsion.org/borgmatic/docs/how-to/monitor-your-backups/

   repositories and report errors afterwards.

1.3.21
 * #192: User-defined hooks for global setup or cleanup that run before/after all actions. See the
   documentation for more information:
   https://torsion.org/borgmatic/docs/how-to/add-preparation-and-cleanup-steps-to-backups/

1.3.20

1.3.7
 * #196: Fix for unclear error message for invalid YAML merge include.
 * #197: Don't color syslog output.
 * Change default syslog verbosity to show errors only.

1.3.6
 * #53: Log to syslog in addition to existing console logging. Add --syslog-verbosity flag to
   customize the log level. See the documentation for more information:
   https://torsion.org/borgmatic/docs/how-to/inspect-your-backups/
 * #178: Look for .yml configuration file extension in addition to .yaml.

 * Get more reproducible builds by pinning the versions of pip and tox used to run tests.
 * Factor out build/test configuration from tox.ini file.

1.3.3
 * Add validate-borgmatic-config command, useful for validating borgmatic config generated by
   configuration management or even edited by hand.

1.3.2
 * #160: Fix for hooks executing when using --dry-run. Now hooks are skipped during a dry run.

1.3.1
 * #155: Fix for invalid JSON output when using multiple borgmatic configuration files.
 * #157: Fix for seemingly random filename ordering when running through a directory of
   configuration files.
 * Fix for empty JSON output when using --create --json.
 * Now capturing Borg output only when --json flag is used. Previously, borgmatic delayed Borg
   output even without the --json flag.
