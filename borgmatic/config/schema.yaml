                    Globs and tildes are expanded. (Note however that a glob
                    pattern must either start with a glob or be an absolute

                                You probably want to specify the "postgres"
                                superuser here when the database name is "all".

                                Omitting a password will only work if PostgreSQL
                                is configured to trust the configured username
