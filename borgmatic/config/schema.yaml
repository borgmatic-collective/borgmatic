                    Use borg's --read-special flag to allow backup of block and other special
                    devices. Use with caution, as it will lead to problems if used when
                    backing up special devices such as /dev/zero
                example: false
            bsd_flags:

            local_path:

                seq:
                    - type: scalar
                desc: |
                    Paths to local or remote repositories (required). Tildes are expanded. Multiple
                    repositories are backed up to in sequence. See ssh_command for SSH options like
                    identity file or port.

                    Any paths matching these patterns are included/excluded from backups. Globs are
                    expanded. (Tildes are not.) Note that Borg considers this option experimental.
                    See the output of "borg help patterns" for more details. Quote any value if it
                    contains leading punctuation, so it parses correctly.

                    Any paths matching these patterns are excluded from backups. Globs and tildes
                    are expanded. See the output of "borg help patterns" for more details.
                example:
                    - '*.pyc'

                    The standard output of this command is used to unlock the encryption key. Only
                    use on repositories that were initialized with passcommand/repokey encryption.
                    Note that if both encryption_passcommand and encryption_passphrase are set,
                    then encryption_passphrase takes precedence.
                example: "secret-tool lookup borg-repository repo-name"
            encryption_passphrase:
                type: scalar

                    Passphrase to unlock the encryption key with. Only use on repositories that were
                    initialized with passphrase/repokey encryption. Quote the value if it contains
                    punctuation, so it parses correctly. And backslash any quote or backslash
                    literals as well.

                desc: |
                    Number of seconds between each checkpoint during a long-running backup. See

                type: scalar
                desc: |
                    Type of compression to use when creating archives. See
                    https://borgbackup.readthedocs.org/en/stable/usage.html#borg-create for details.
                    Defaults to no compression.

                type: scalar
                desc: |
                    Name of the archive. Borg placeholders can be used. See the output of
                    "borg help placeholders" for details. Default is
                    "{hostname}-{now:%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%f}". If you specify this option, you must
                    also specify a prefix in the retention section to avoid accidental pruning of
                    archives with a different archive name format. And you should also specify a
                    prefix in the consistency section as well.
                example: "{hostname}-documents-{now}"
    retention:
        desc: |
            Retention policy for how many backups to keep in each category. See
            https://borgbackup.readthedocs.org/en/stable/usage.html#borg-prune for details.
            At least one of the "keep" options is required for pruning to work.

                desc: Number of yearly archives to keep.
                example: 1
            prefix:
                type: scalar
                desc: |
                    When pruning, only consider archive names starting with this prefix.
                    Borg placeholders can be used. See the output of "borg help placeholders" for
                    details. Default is "{hostname}-".
                example: sourcehostname
    consistency:

                    List of one or more consistency checks to run: "repository", "archives", and/or
                    "extract". Defaults to "repository" and "archives". Set to "disabled" to disable
                    all consistency checks. "repository" checks the consistency of the repository,
                    "archive" checks all of the archives, and "extract" does an extraction dry-run
                    of just the most recent archive.
                example:
                    - repository

                desc: |
                    When performing the "archives" check, only consider archive names starting with

                    "borg help placeholders" for details. Default is "{hostname}-".

            Do not forget to set secure permissions on this file as well as on any script listed (chmod 0700) to
