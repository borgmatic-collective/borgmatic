                    List of source directories to backup (required). Globs and
                    tildes are expanded.
                example:

                    Paths to local or remote repositories (required). Tildes are
                    expanded. Multiple repositories are backed up to in
                    sequence. See ssh_command for SSH options like identity file
                    or port.

                desc: |
                    Stay in same file system (do not cross mount points).
                    Defaults to false. But when a database hook is used, the
                    setting here is ignored and one_file_system is considered
                    true.
                example: true
            numeric_owner:
                type: bool
                desc: |
                    Only store/extract numeric user and group identifiers.
                    Defaults to false.

                desc: |
                    Store birthtime (creation date) into archive. Defaults to
                    true.
                example: false
            read_special:
                type: bool
                desc: |
                    Use Borg's --read-special flag to allow backup of block and
                    other special devices. Use with caution, as it will lead to
                    problems if used when backing up special devices such as
                    /dev/zero. Defaults to false. But when a database hook is
                    used, the setting here is ignored and read_special is
                    considered true.
                example: false
            bsd_flags:
                type: bool

                    Any paths matching these patterns are included/excluded from
                    backups. Globs are expanded. (Tildes are not.) Note that
                    Borg considers this option experimental. See the output of
                    "borg help patterns" for more details. Quote any value if it
                    contains leading punctuation, so it parses correctly.

                    Read include/exclude patterns from one or more separate
                    named files, one pattern per line. Note that Borg considers
                    this option experimental. See the output of "borg help
                    patterns" for more details.
                example:

                    Any paths matching these patterns are excluded from backups.
                    Globs and tildes are expanded. See the output of "borg help
                    patterns" for more details.
                example:

                    - ~/*/.cache
                    - /etc/ssl
            exclude_from:
                seq:
                    - type: str
                desc: |
                    Read exclude patterns from one or more separate named files,
                    one pattern per line. See the output of "borg help patterns"
                    for more details.
                example:

            exclude_caches:
                type: bool
                desc: |
                    Exclude directories that contain a CACHEDIR.TAG file. See
                    http://www.brynosaurus.com/cachedir/spec.html for details.
                    Defaults to false.
                example: true
            exclude_if_present:
                seq:
                    - type: str
                desc: |
                    Exclude directories that contain a file with the given
                    filenames. Defaults to not set.
                example:
                    - .nobackup
            keep_exclude_tags:
                type: bool
                desc: |
                    If true, the exclude_if_present filename is included in
                    backups. Defaults to false, meaning that the
                    exclude_if_present filename is omitted from backups.
                example: true
            exclude_nodump:
                type: bool
                desc: |
                    Exclude files with the NODUMP flag. Defaults to false.

                    Path for additional source files used for temporary internal
                    state like borgmatic database dumps. Note that changing this
                    path prevents "borgmatic restore" from finding any database
                    dumps created before the change. Defaults to ~/.borgmatic
                example: /tmp/borgmatic

                desc: |
                    The standard output of this command is used to unlock the
                    encryption key. Only use on repositories that were
                    initialized with passcommand/repokey encryption. Note that
                    if both encryption_passcommand and encryption_passphrase are
                    set, then encryption_passphrase takes precedence. Defaults
                    to not set.
                example: "secret-tool lookup borg-repository repo-name"
            encryption_passphrase:

                desc: |
                    Passphrase to unlock the encryption key with. Only use on
                    repositories that were initialized with passphrase/repokey
                    encryption. Quote the value if it contains punctuation, so
                    it parses correctly. And backslash any quote or backslash
                    literals as well. Defaults to not set.
                example: "!\"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~"

                    for details. Defaults to checkpoints every 1800 seconds (30
                    minutes).
                example: 1800
            chunker_params:
                type: str
                desc: |
                    Specify the parameters passed to then chunker
                    (CHUNK_MIN_EXP, CHUNK_MAX_EXP, HASH_MASK_BITS,

                desc: |
                    Path for Borg configuration files. Defaults to
                    $borg_base_directory/.config/borg
                example: /path/to/base/config
            borg_cache_directory:
                type: str
                desc: |
                    Path for Borg cache files. Defaults to

                    "{hostname}-{now:%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%f}". If you specify this
                    option, you must also specify a prefix in the retention
                    section to avoid accidental pruning of archives with a
                    different archive name format. And you should also specify a
                    prefix in the consistency section as well.

                    Additional options to pass directly to particular Borg
                    commands, handy for Borg options that borgmatic does not yet
                    support natively. Note that borgmatic does not perform any
                    validation on these options. Running borgmatic with
                    "--verbosity 2" shows the exact Borg command-line
                    invocation.

            Retention policy for how many backups to keep in each category. See
            https://borgbackup.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage/prune.html for
            details. At least one of the "keep" options is required for pruning
            to work. See borgmatic documentation if you'd like to skip pruning
            entirely.

                    "archives", "data", and/or "extract". Defaults to
                    "repository" and "archives". Set to "disabled" to disable
                    all consistency checks. "repository" checks the consistency
                    of the repository, "archives" checks all of the archives,
                    "data" verifies the integrity of the data within the
                    archives, and "extract" does an extraction dry-run of the
                    most recent archive. Note that "data" implies "archives".

                    section on which to run consistency checks. Handy in case
                    some of your repositories are very large, and so running
                    consistency checks on them would take too long. Defaults to
                    running consistency checks on all repositories configured in
                    the location section.
                example:

                    Restrict the number of checked archives to the last n.
                    Applies only to the "archives" check. Defaults to checking
                    all archives.
                example: 3
            prefix:
                type: str
                desc: |
                    When performing the "archives" check, only consider archive
                    names starting with this prefix. Borg placeholders can be
                    used. See the output of "borg help placeholders" for
                    details. Defaults to "{hostname}-". Use an empty value to

                                "all" to dump all databases on the host. Note
                                that using this database hook implicitly enables
                                both read_special and one_file_system (see
                                above) to support dump and restore streaming.
                            example: users

                            example: database.example.org

                                Defaults to the username of the current user.
                                You probably want to specify the "postgres"
                                superuser here when the database name is "all".
                            example: dbuser

                                Password with which to connect to the database.
                                Omitting a password will only work if PostgreSQL
                                is configured to trust the configured username
                                without a password, or you create a ~/.pgpass
                                file.
                            example: trustsome1

                                Database dump output format. One of "plain",
                                "custom", "directory", or "tar". Defaults to
                                "custom" (unlike raw pg_dump). See pg_dump
                                documentation for details. Note that format is
                                ignored when the database name is "all".

                                SSL mode to use to connect to the database server. One of "disable", "allow", "prefer",
                                "require", "verify-ca" or "verify-full". Defaults to "disable". See
