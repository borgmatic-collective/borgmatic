            is with a different compression algorithm.
             * "always": Recompress even if the current compression
            is with the same compression algorithm. Use this to change
            the compression level.
             * "never": Do not recompress. Use this option to explicitly
            prevent recompression.

                        Whether to consider the exit code as an error or as a
                        warning in borgmatic.
                    example: error
        description: |
            A list of Borg exit codes that should be elevated to errors or
            squashed to warnings as indicated. By default, Borg error exit codes
            (2 to 99) are treated as errors while warning exit codes (1 and
            100+) are treated as warnings. Exit codes other than 1 and 2 are
            only present in Borg 1.4.0+.
        example:
            - code: 13
              treat_as: warning
            - code: 100
              treat_as: error
    umask:
        type: integer
        description: |
            Umask used for when executing Borg or calling hooks. Defaults to
            0077 for Borg or the umask that borgmatic is run with for hooks.
        example: 0077

        description: |

    archive_name_format:
        type: string
        description: |
            Name of the archive to create. Borg placeholders can be used. See
            the output of "borg help placeholders" for details. Defaults to
            "{hostname}-{now:%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%f}" with Borg 1 and
            "{hostname}" with Borg 2, as Borg 2 does not require unique
            archive names; identical archive names form a common "series" that
            can be targeted together. When running actions like repo-list,
            info, or check, borgmatic automatically tries to match only
            archives created with this name format.
        example: "{hostname}-documents-{now}"
    match_archives:
        type: string
        description: |
            A Borg pattern for filtering down the archives used by borgmatic
            actions that operate on multiple archives. For Borg 1.x, use a shell
            pattern here and see the output of "borg help placeholders" for
            details. For Borg 2.x, see the output of "borg help match-archives".
            If match_archives is not specified, borgmatic defaults to deriving
            the match_archives value from archive_name_format.

            When set true, display debugging information that includes

        type: boolean
        description: |

                              check (as a best effort). The value is a number
                              followed by a unit of time. E.g., "2 weeks" to
                              run this consistency check no more than every
                              two weeks for a given repository or "1 month" to
                              run it no more than monthly. Defaults to
                              "always": running this check every time checks
                              are run.

                              matches one of these values (the name of a day of
                              the week in the current locale). "weekday" and
                              "weekend" are also accepted. Defaults to running

                              archive file count that is allowed before the
                              entire consistency check fails. This can catch
                              problems like incorrect excludes, inadvertent
                              deletes, etc. Required (and only valid) for the

                              can catch problems like source files that have

                              source files, usually found in an OS package named
                              "xxhash". Do not substitute with a different hash
                              type (SHA, MD5, etc.) or the check will never

                        is "all" and format is blank, dumps all databases to a

                        that format, allowing more convenient restores of

                        How to transmit database passwords from borgmatic to the
                        MariaDB client, one of:
                         * "pipe": Securely transmit passwords via anonymous
                           pipe. Only works if the database client is on the
                           same host as borgmatic. (The server can be
                           somewhere else.) This is the default value.
                         * "environment": Transmit passwords via environment
                           variable. Potentially less secure than a pipe, but
                           necessary when the database client is elsewhere, e.g.
                           when "mariadb_dump_command" is configured to "exec"
                           into a container and run a client there.

                        How to transmit database passwords from borgmatic to the
                        MySQL client, one of:
                         * "pipe": Securely transmit passwords via anonymous
                           pipe. Only works if the database client is on the
                           same host as borgmatic. (The server can be
                           somewhere else.) This is the default value.
                         * "environment": Transmit passwords via environment
                           variable. Potentially less secure than a pipe, but
                           necessary when the database client is elsewhere, e.g.
                           when "mysql_dump_command" is configured to "exec"
                           into a container and run a client there.
