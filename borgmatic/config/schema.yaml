                    Use Borg's --read-special flag to allow backup of block and other special
                    devices. Use with caution, as it will lead to problems if used when

                    Any paths matching these patterns are included/excluded from backups. Globs are

                    See the output of "borg help patterns" for more details. Quote any value if it
                    contains leading punctuation, so it parses correctly.

                    If true, the exclude_if_present filename is included in backups. Defaults to
                    false, meaning that the exclude_if_present filename is omitted from backups.
                example: true
            exclude_nodump:
                type: bool
                desc: |

                    "{hostname}-{now:%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%f}". If you specify this option, you must
                    also specify a prefix in the retention section to avoid accidental pruning of

            Retention policy for how many backups to keep in each category. See
            https://borgbackup.readthedocs.org/en/stable/usage.html#borg-prune for details.
            At least one of the "keep" options is required for pruning to work. See
            https://torsion.org/borgmatic/docs/how-to/deal-with-very-large-backups/
            if you'd like to skip pruning entirely.

                    When pruning, only consider archive names starting with this prefix.
                    Borg placeholders can be used. See the output of "borg help placeholders" for
                    details. Defaults to "{hostname}-". Use an empty value to disable the default.
                example: sourcehostname
    consistency:
        desc: |
            Consistency checks to run after backups. See

                    disable all consistency checks. "repository" checks the consistency of the
                    repository, "archives" checks all of the archives, "data" verifies the integrity
                    of the data within the archives, and "extract" does an extraction dry-run of the
                    most recent archive. Note that "data" implies "archives".

                    Paths to a subset of the repositories in the location section on which to run
                    consistency checks. Handy in case some of your repositories are very large, and
                    so running consistency checks on them would take too long. Defaults to running
                    consistency checks on all repositories configured in the location section.
                example:

                desc: Restrict the number of checked archives to the last n. Applies only to the
                      "archives" check. Defaults to checking all archives.
                example: 3
            prefix:

                desc: |
                    When performing the "archives" check, only consider archive names starting with
                    this prefix. Borg placeholders can be used. See the output of
                    "borg help placeholders" for details. Defaults to "{hostname}-". Use an empty
                    value to disable the default.

    hooks:

            Shell commands, scripts, or integrations to execute at various points during a borgmatic
            run. IMPORTANT: All provided commands and scripts are executed with user permissions of
            borgmatic. Do not forget to set secure permissions on this configuration file (chmod
            0600) as well as on any script called from a hook (chmod 0700) to prevent potential
            shell injection or privilege escalation.

                    occurs during a backup or when running a before_backup or after_backup hook.
                example:

                                Database name (required if using this hook). Or "all" to dump all
                                databases on the host.

                                Unix socket.
                            example: database.example.org

                                Username with which to connect to the database. Defaults to the
                                username of the current user. You probably want to specify the
                                "postgres" superuser here when the database name is "all".
                            example: dbuser

                                Password with which to connect to the database. Omitting a password
                                will only work if PostgreSQL is configured to trust the configured
                                username without a password, or you create a ~/.pgpass file.

                                Database dump output format. One of "plain", "custom", "directory",
                                or "tar". Defaults to "custom" (unlike raw pg_dump). See
                                https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-pgdump.html for details.
                                Note that format is ignored when the database name is "all".

                    List of one or more PostgreSQL databases to dump before creating a backup,

                    directories at runtime, backed up, and then removed afterwards. Requires
                    pg_dump/pg_dumpall/pg_restore commands. See
                    https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-pgdump.html for details.
