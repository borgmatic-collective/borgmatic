                    Use Borg's --read-special flag to allow backup of block and other special
                    devices. Use with caution, as it will lead to problems if used when
                    backing up special devices such as /dev/zero. Defaults to false.
                example: false
            bsd_flags:

                    See the output of "borg help patterns" for more details. Quote any value if it
                    contains leading punctuation, so it parses correctly.

                    The standard output of this command is used to unlock the encryption key. Only
                    use on repositories that were initialized with passcommand/repokey encryption.
                    Note that if both encryption_passcommand and encryption_passphrase are set,
                    then encryption_passphrase takes precedence. Defaults to not set.
                example: "secret-tool lookup borg-repository repo-name"

                    "{hostname}-{now:%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%f}". If you specify this option, you must
                    also specify a prefix in the retention section to avoid accidental pruning of
                    archives with a different archive name format. And you should also specify a
                    prefix in the consistency section as well.

                desc: Number of monthly archives to keep.
                example: 6

                type: scalar
                desc: |

                      unique: true
                desc: |
                    List of one or more consistency checks to run: "repository", "archives", and/or
                    "extract". Defaults to "repository" and "archives". Set to "disabled" to disable
                    all consistency checks. "repository" checks the consistency of the repository,
                    "archive" checks all of the archives, and "extract" does an extraction dry-run
                    of the most recent archive.
                example:

                    Paths to a subset of the repositories in the location section on which to run
                    consistency checks. Handy in case some of your repositories are very large, and
                    so running consistency checks on them would take too long. Defaults to running
                    consistency checks on all repositories configured in the location section.
                example:
                    - user@backupserver:sourcehostname.borg
            check_last:
                type: int
                desc: Restrict the number of checked archives to the last n. Applies only to the
                      "archives" check. Defaults to checking all archives.
                example: 3
            prefix:
                type: scalar
                desc: |
                    When performing the "archives" check, only consider archive names starting with
                    this prefix. Borg placeholders can be used. See the output of
                    "borg help placeholders" for details. Defaults to "{hostname}-".
