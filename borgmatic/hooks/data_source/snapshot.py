    Given a parent directory and a set of candidate directories potentially inside it, get the
    subset of contained directories for which the parent directory is actually the parent, a
    grandparent, the very same directory, etc. The idea is if, say, /var/log and /var/lib are
    candidate contained directories, but there's a parent directory (logical volume, dataset,
    subvolume, etc.) at /var, then /var is what we want to snapshot.

    Also mutate the given set of candidate contained directories to remove any actually contained
    directories from it. That way, this function can be called multiple times, successively
    processing candidate directories until none are leftâ€”and avoiding assigning any candidate
    directory to more than one parent directory.
