def get_contained_patterns(parent_directory, candidate_patterns):
    '''
    Given a parent directory and a set of candidate patterns potentially inside it, get the subset
    of contained patterns for which the parent directory is actually the parent, a grandparent, the
    very same directory, etc. The idea is if, say, /var/log and /var/lib are candidate pattern
    paths, but there's a parent directory (logical volume, dataset, subvolume, etc.) at /var, then
    /var is what we want to snapshot.

    For this to work, a candidate pattern path can't have any globs or other non-literal characters
    in the initial portion of the path that matches the parent directory. For instance, a parent
    directory of /var would match a candidate pattern path of /var/log/*/data, but not a pattern
    path like /v*/log/*/data.

    The one exception is that if a regular expression pattern path starts with "^", that will get
    stripped off for purposes of matching against a parent directory.

    As part of this, also mutate the given set of candidate patterns to remove any actually
    contained patterns from it. That way, this function can be called multiple times, successively
    processing candidate patterns until none are leftâ€”and avoiding assigning any candidate pattern
    to more than one parent directory.
