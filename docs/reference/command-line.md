## borgmatic options

Here are all of the available borgmatic command-line options, including the
separate options for each action sub-command. Note that most of the
flags listed here do have equivalents in borgmatic's [configuration
file](https://torsion.org/borgmatic/docs/reference/configuration/).

```
{% include borgmatic/command-line.txt %}
```
