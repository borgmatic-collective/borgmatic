[Sentry](https://sentry.io/) is an application monitoring service that
includes cron-style monitoring (either cloud-hosted or
[self-hosted](https://develop.sentry.dev/self-hosted/)).

To get started, create a [Sentry cron
monitor](https://docs.sentry.io/product/crons/) in the Sentry UI. Under
"Instrument your monitor," select "Sentry CLI" and copy the URL value for the
displayed
[`SENTRY_DSN`](https://docs.sentry.io/concepts/key-terms/dsn-explainer/)
environment variable into borgmatic's Sentry `data_source_name_url`
configuration option. For example:

```yaml
sentry:
    data_source_name_url: https://5f80ec@o294220.ingest.us.sentry.io/203069
    monitor_slug: mymonitor
```

The `monitor_slug` value comes from the "Monitor Slug" under "Cron Details" on
the same Sentry monitor page.

With this configuration, borgmatic pings Sentry whenever borgmatic starts,
finishes, or fails, but only when any of the `create`, `prune`, `compact`, or
`check` actions are run. You can optionally override the start/finish/fail
behavior with the `states` configuration option. For instance, to only ping
Sentry on failure:

```yaml
sentry:
    data_source_name_url: https://5f80ec@o294220.ingest.us.sentry.io/203069
    monitor_slug: mymonitor
    states:
      - fail
```
